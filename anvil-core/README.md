# Anvil: Your Team's Collective Memory

**Status:** Active Development | **Goal:** Prevent repeated mistakes through team-specific pattern learning

## What is Anvil?

Anvil is a local-first, privacy-preserving tool that learns from your team's git history to prevent repeated mistakes and preserve institutional knowledge. Think of it as your team's collective memory—it remembers what went wrong before so you don't repeat it.

## Core Features

### 1. Mistake Prevention System
**Problem:** Teams fix the same types of bugs repeatedly.  
**Solution:** Anvil analyzes your git history to identify patterns in bug fixes and warns you when you're about to repeat a past mistake.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes commit messages, diffs, and fix patterns
- Builds a database of "mistake signatures"
- Provides real-time warnings in your IDE
- Learns from false positives to improve accuracy

**Current Status:** Designing proof-of-concept
**Target Accuracy:** 80%+ detection, <10% false positives

### 2. Semantic Comment System
**Problem:** Comments become outdated when code moves or refactors.  
**Solution:** Comments attached to code meaning, not line numbers.

**How it works:**
- Creates semantic fingerprints of code blocks
- Tracks code through refactoring
- Preserves the "why" behind changes
- Surfaces relevant context when needed

**Current Status:** Algorithm design phase
**Target Accuracy:** 85%+ tracking through refactors

### 3. Team Knowledge Capture
**Problem:** Institutional knowledge leaves with developers.  
**Solution:** Automatically extract and preserve team wisdom from code evolution.

**How it works:**
- Mines patterns from code reviews
- Extracts insights from commit messages
- Identifies team-specific conventions
- Builds searchable knowledge base

**Current Status:** Conceptual design
**Target Coverage:** Capture 60%+ of reviewable patterns

## Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Challenges

**Challenge:** High false positive rate  
**Current State:** Unknown (no implementation yet)  
**Mitigation Strategy:** 
- Start with high-confidence patterns only
- Implement user feedback loop
- Use adaptive thresholds per team
- Allow pattern whitelisting

**Challenge:** Performance with large repositories  
**Current State:** Theoretical concern  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Incremental analysis
- Smart caching strategies
- Background processing
- Selective pattern matching

**Challenge:** Git history noise  
**Current State:** Known issue from research  
**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Advanced filtering algorithms
- Focus on high-quality commits
- Learn team-specific commit patterns
- Combine multiple signals

### Adoption Challenges

**Challenge:** Developer skepticism  
**Mitigation:** Start with opt-in warnings, prove value incrementally

**Challenge:** Privacy concerns  
**Mitigation:** Local-first architecture, no data leaves machine

**Challenge:** Integration complexity  
**Mitigation:** Start with popular IDEs, simple CLI tool

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Pattern Detection Accuracy:** Target 80%+
- **False Positive Rate:** Target <10%
- **Performance:** <100ms response time
- **Coverage:** 90%+ of common mistake patterns

### User Metrics
- **Adoption:** 10+ teams using regularly
- **Retention:** 70%+ active after 3 months
- **Prevented Mistakes:** Measurable reduction
- **User Satisfaction:** NPS >30

## Why Anvil Will Succeed

### 1. Solves Real Problem
Every developer has experienced:
- Fixing the same bug twice
- Losing context during refactoring
- Missing critical knowledge from departed teammates

### 2. Local-First Privacy
- No cloud dependency
- Your code never leaves your machine
- Team owns their data

### 3. Progressive Value
- Useful from day one
- Improves with usage
- Adapts to your team

### 4. Foundation for Research
Data from Anvil usage will:
- Validate pattern hypotheses
- Inform universal classification research
- Build evidence for larger vision

## Getting Started

### For Contributors
1. Review [Technical Architecture](architecture/)
2. Check [Open Issues](https://github.com/devknowledge-ai/code-periodic-table/issues)
3. Read [Development Setup](docs/development.md)
4. Join [Discord Community](#)

### For Early Adopters
- Sign up for beta access
- Provide repository for testing
- Share feedback and use cases

### For Researchers
- Review our [hypotheses](../STATE_OF_HYPOTHESES.md)
- Suggest experiments
- Contribute analysis methods

## The Bigger Picture

While Anvil is our immediate focus, it's also the foundation for something larger. Every pattern we detect, every mistake we prevent, contributes to our long-term research into universal code classification. 

But even if that grand vision never materializes, Anvil alone will make your team more effective.
