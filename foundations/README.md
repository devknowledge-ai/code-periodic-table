# Foundations Directory

## ⚠️ Status: Empty Placeholder

This directory contains only empty subdirectories and no actual implementations.

## What Was Intended

### `/knowledge-graph/`
- Graph database schemas
- Pattern relationship models
- Query interfaces
- **Current State**: Empty

### `/semantic-fingerprinting/`
- Cross-language pattern matching algorithms
- Fingerprint generation code
- Similarity metrics
- **Current State**: Empty

### `/vscode-integration/`
- VS Code extension code
- Language server protocol implementation
- UI components
- **Current State**: Empty

### `/vulnerability-detection/`
- Security pattern analyzers
- Vulnerability databases
- Detection algorithms
- **Current State**: Empty

## Why These Exist

These directories represent the architectural vision of what foundational components would be needed if the project were implemented. They serve as documentation of intended structure, not existing functionality.

## The Reality

No foundational code has been written. The project remains in the conceptual/research phase with no working implementations.

## For More Information

- See `/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for overall project status
- Review `/03-research-vision/` for theoretical foundations
- Check `/reality-check/` for honest assessment of challenges
