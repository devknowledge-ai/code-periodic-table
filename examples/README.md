# Examples and Demonstrations

**Status: Illustrative Examples - Conceptual Demonstrations**

## Overview

This directory contains examples demonstrating the concepts and potential applications of the Code Periodic Table system. These are theoretical examples showing how the system would work if implemented.

## Example Categories

### [Basic Patterns](./basic-patterns/)
Simple examples of pattern classification and recognition.
- **Example:** Singleton pattern classification
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate classification approach
- **Complexity:** Low

### [Semantic Fingerprints](./semantic-fingerprints/)
Examples of semantic fingerprinting across languages.
- **Example:** Cross-language comparison
- **Purpose:** Show semantic similarity detection
- **Complexity:** Medium

### [Use Cases](./use-cases/)
Real-world scenarios and applications.
- **Example:** Bug prevention scenario
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate practical value
- **Complexity:** High

### [Complete Flow](./complete-flow.md)
End-to-end example of the entire system.
- **Purpose:** Show full workflow
- **Coverage:** Detection → Classification → Application

## Example Format

Each example follows this structure:

```markdown
# Example: [Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what this example demonstrates

## Input
The code or pattern being analyzed

## Process
Step-by-step explanation of the analysis

## Output
The results or classifications produced

## Insights
What we learn from this example

## Variations

## Quick Examples

### Pattern Detection Example
```python
# Input Code
class DatabaseConnection:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Detection Result
Pattern Detected: Singleton
Category: Creational
Confidence: 95%
Properties: {
    "thread-safe": false,
    "lazy-init": true,
    "testability": "low"
}
```

### Cross-Language Recognition
```javascript
// JavaScript
const items = data.map(x => x * 2).filter(x => x > 10);

# Python
items = [x * 2 for x in data if x * 2 > 10]

// Result: Same semantic fingerprint detected
Fingerprint: MAP-FILTER-ARITHMETIC
Similarity: 92%
```

### Bug Prevention Scenario
```java
// Historical bug: NullPointerException
user.getProfile().getSettings().getTheme();

// System Alert:
⚠️ Pattern previously caused NPE in 3 commits
Suggestion: Add null checks or use Optional
Similar fixes: commits #a3f2, #b891, #c234
```

## Interactive Examples

### Try It Yourself (Conceptual)
```bash
# Analyze a pattern
$ cpt analyze --file example.py --pattern singleton

# Compare implementations
$ cpt compare implementation1.js implementation2.py

# Find similar patterns
$ cpt search --similar-to "observer-pattern.java"

# Get recommendations
$ cpt suggest --context "event-handling"
```

## Learning Path

### Beginner
1. Start with [basic-patterns](./basic-patterns/)
2. Understand classification concepts
3. Try simple pattern recognition

### Intermediate
1. Explore [semantic-fingerprints](./semantic-fingerprints/)
2. Learn cross-language concepts
3. Understand similarity metrics

### Advanced
1. Study [use-cases](./use-cases/)
2. Explore complex scenarios
3. Consider edge cases

## Common Patterns Catalog

### Creational Patterns
- Singleton: Global instance management
- Factory: Object creation abstraction
- Builder: Complex object construction
- Prototype: Object cloning

### Structural Patterns
- Adapter: Interface compatibility
- Decorator: Dynamic behavior addition
- Facade: Simplified interface
- Proxy: Placeholder/representative

### Behavioral Patterns
- Observer: Event notification
- Strategy: Algorithm selection
- Command: Action encapsulation
- Iterator: Sequential access

## Anti-Pattern Examples

### What Not to Do
```python
# Anti-pattern: God Object
class EverythingManager:
    def handle_database(self): ...
    def process_ui(self): ...
    def manage_network(self): ...
    def control_everything(self): ...
    # 500+ more methods

# System Detection:
Anti-pattern: God Object
Issues: High coupling, low cohesion
Suggestion: Split into focused classes
```
