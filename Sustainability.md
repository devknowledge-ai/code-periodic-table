# Sustainability Model

## Overview

This document outlines how we plan to sustain the Anvil project and associated research through its development phases. Our approach prioritizes research grants and open-source sustainability over premature commercialization.

## Current Phase: Research Funding (Years 0-2)

### Primary Funding Sources

#### Research Grants
**Target: $500K-$1M over 2 years**

Potential sources:
- **NSF SBIR/STTR** - Small Business Innovation Research
  - Phase I: $50-250K (6 months, feasibility)
  - Phase II: $750K-1M (2 years, development)
- **DARPA** - Software engineering research programs
- **Academic Partnerships** - Joint research with universities
- **Corporate Research Grants** - Microsoft Research, Google Research

Grant positioning:
- Fundamental research in software engineering
- Pattern recognition and machine learning applications
- Developer productivity improvements
- Open-source tool development

#### Open Source Sponsorship
**Target: $50-100K/year**

- **GitHub Sponsors** - Individual and corporate sponsors
- **Open Collective** - Transparent funding platform
- **Corporate Sponsorship** - Companies using Anvil
- **Patreon** - Community support model

### Resource Allocation

**Year 1 Budget (Estimated $250K)**
- Research/Development (70%): $175K
  - 2 full-time developers/researchers
- Infrastructure (10%): $25K
  - Cloud services, testing infrastructure
- Community (10%): $25K
  - Documentation, outreach, conferences
- Operations (10%): $25K
  - Legal, accounting, misc.

## Future Phases: Sustainable Growth

### Phase 2: Hybrid Model (Years 2-3)
If Anvil proves valuable:

**Open Core Model**
- Core Anvil: Free and open source
- Premium features:
  - Enterprise integration
  - Advanced analytics
  - Priority support
  - Team dashboards

**Service Revenue**
- Hosted version for teams
- Custom pattern development
- Training and consulting
- Research partnerships

### Phase 3: Research Institute (Years 3+)
If research vision shows promise:

**Non-Profit Research Organization**
- Similar to Mozilla, Apache Foundation
- Focus on advancing software engineering
- Funded by:
  - Corporate members
  - Government grants
  - Individual donors
  - Service revenue

## Community Sustainability

### Building a Contributor Base

**Incentives for Contributors:**
- Recognition in publications
- Conference speaking opportunities
- Skill development
- Resume building
- Potential employment

**Community Governance:**
- Technical steering committee
- Community advisory board
- Transparent decision-making
- Regular contributor meetings

### Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

**Ensuring Project Continuity:**
- Comprehensive documentation
- Video tutorials
- Architecture decision records
- Onboarding guides
- Regular knowledge sharing sessions

## Metrics for Sustainability

### Financial Health
- [ ] 18+ months runway maintained
- [ ] Multiple funding sources (not dependent on single source)
- [ ] <50% dependency on any single funder
- [ ] Positive cash flow by Year 3

### Community Health
- [ ] 20+ regular contributors
- [ ] 100+ GitHub stars
- [ ] Active discussion forums
- [ ] Regular release cycle
- [ ] Documentation kept current

### Research Impact
- [ ] 3+ published papers
- [ ] Conference presentations
- [ ] Citations by other researchers
- [ ] Tool adoption metrics

## Risk Mitigation

### If Grant Funding Fails
- Pivot to part-time development
- Seek corporate sponsorship
- Consider accelerator programs
- Explore consulting revenue

### If Community Doesn't Grow
- Increase outreach efforts
- Simplify contribution process
- Partner with universities
- Create "good first issue" program

### If Technical Approach Fails
- Document learnings openly
- Pivot to simpler solution
- Focus on subset of features
- Consider joining larger project

## Ethical Considerations

### Commitment to Open Source
- Core functionality always free
- No vendor lock-in
- Data portability guaranteed
- Community-first decision making

### Privacy & Security
- Local-first architecture
- No telemetry without consent
- Security-first design
- Regular audits

### Inclusive Development
- Welcome all contributors
- Mentorship programs
- Documentation in multiple languages
- Accessibility considerations

## Current Status & Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next 3 months)
1. **Prepare NSF SBIR Phase I Application**
   - Deadline: [Next cycle]
   - Amount: $250K
   - Duration: 6 months

2. **Launch GitHub Sponsors**
   - Set up tiers
   - Create sponsor benefits
   - Initial outreach

3. **Academic Partnerships**
   - Reach out to 5 universities
   - Propose joint research
   - Seek student contributors

### Funding Pipeline
| Source | Amount | Probability | Timeline |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| NSF SBIR Phase I | $250K | 40% | 6 months |
| University Grant | $50K | 60% | 3 months |
| GitHub Sponsors | $20K/year | 70% | Ongoing |
| Corporate Grant | $100K | 30% | 9 months |

## Conclusion

Our sustainability model prioritizes:
1. **Research integrity** over premature commercialization
2. **Community building** over rapid growth
3. **Open source values** over profit maximization
4. **Long-term impact** over short-term gains

By focusing on grants and community support initially, we can build Anvil properly without the pressure of venture capital or premature monetization. If the tool proves valuable, natural paths to sustainability will emerge.
