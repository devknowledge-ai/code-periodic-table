## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
| Experiment | Target | Current | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|---------|
| AI Property Extraction | 70% accuracy | 60% | In Progress |

- Scalability potential

## Failed Experiments

We document failures for learning:

### Universal Pattern Language (2023)
**Hypothesis:** Single notation for all patterns
**Result:** Failed - Lost semantic meaning
**Learning:** Domain-specific is better

### Automatic Pattern Discovery (2023)
**Hypothesis:** Unsupervised pattern finding
**Result:** Failed - 90% noise
**Learning:** Human expertise essential
