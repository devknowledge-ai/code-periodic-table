# Semantic Fingerprinting Experiment

**Status: Active Research - Most Promising Approach**

## Overview

This directory contains research and experiments on semantic fingerprinting - creating unique identifiers for code patterns based on their semantic meaning rather than syntactic structure. This enables pattern matching across different implementations and languages.

## Research Documents

### [Semantic Fingerprinting Theory](./semantic-fingerprinting.md)
Detailed exploration of the semantic fingerprinting approach, algorithms, and challenges.

## Current Status

### Progress Metrics
| Aspect | Achievement | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Same-language accuracy | 75% | 85% |
| Same-paradigm accuracy | 60% | 75% |
| Cross-paradigm accuracy | 40% | 50% |
| Processing speed | 100ms/file | 50ms/file |

### Key Findings
- Semantic similarity can be quantified
- Structure matters more than syntax
- Context affects fingerprint accuracy
- Hybrid approaches show promise

## Fingerprinting Algorithm

### Core Components

#### 1. AST Normalization
Remove language-specific details while preserving structure:
```python
def normalize_ast(code):
    ast = parse(code)
    # Remove variable names
    # Standardize operators
    # Abstract control flow
    return normalized_ast
```

#### 2. Feature Extraction
Extract semantic features:
- Control flow patterns
- Data dependencies
- Operation sequences
- Structural relationships

#### 3. Vector Generation
Convert features to numerical representation:
- Embedding techniques
- Dimensionality reduction
- Normalization

#### 4. Fingerprint Creation
Generate stable identifier:
- Hashing mechanisms
- Error correction
- Similarity preservation
