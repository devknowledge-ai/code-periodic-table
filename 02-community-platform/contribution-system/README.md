# Contribution System

**Status: Architecture Design - Pending Phase 1 Completion**

## Overview

The contribution system defines how community members will share, validate, and maintain pattern knowledge within their domains. This system is designed to balance open collaboration with quality control.

## Core Principles

1. **Quality over Quantity** - Better to have few validated patterns than many unverified ones
2. **Domain Expertise** - Contributors should have experience in their domain
3. **Privacy First** - No source code exposure, only abstracted patterns
4. **Community Validation** - Peer review ensures pattern quality

## Contribution Workflow

### Step 1: Pattern Discovery
Contributors identify valuable patterns in their work:
- Recurring solutions to common problems
- Performance optimizations
- Security best practices
- Anti-patterns to avoid

### Step 2: Pattern Abstraction
Convert concrete code into abstract pattern:

```javascript
// Original Code (Private)
const processPayment = async (customerId, amount) => {
    await validateCustomer(customerId);
    await checkFraudRisk(customerId, amount);
    const result = await chargeCard(customerId, amount);
    await logTransaction(result);
    return result;
};

// Abstract Pattern (Shareable)
Pattern: "Sequential Validation Pipeline"
Properties:
- Type: async-sequential-processing
- Domain: payment-processing
- Steps: [validation, risk-check, execution, logging]
- Error-handling: fail-fast
- Performance: O(n) where n = pipeline steps
```

### Step 3: Pattern Submission

**Required Information:**
- Pattern name and description
- Domain classification
- Properties and metadata
- Use cases and examples
- Known limitations

**Optional Information:**
- Performance metrics
- Security implications
- Migration guides
- Related patterns

### Step 4: Community Review

**Review Process:**
1. Automated checks (format, duplicates)
2. Domain expert review (minimum 3)
3. Community voting period (7 days)
4. Final approval or revision request

**Review Criteria:**
- Accuracy and correctness
- Generalizability within domain
- Clear documentation
- No proprietary information

### Step 5: Integration

**Accepted patterns are:**
- Added to domain library
- Tagged with contributor credit
- Versioned for updates
- Made available to community

## Contribution Types

### Pattern Contributions
- New pattern discoveries
- Pattern optimizations
- Cross-domain patterns
- Anti-pattern documentation

### Validation Contributions
- Review and voting
- Testing in projects
- Performance benchmarking
- Security auditing

### Documentation Contributions
- Usage examples
- Migration guides
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guides

### Research Contributions
- Pattern analysis
- Empirical studies
- Comparative evaluations
- Theoretical frameworks

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
```yaml
pattern_validation:
  - syntax_check: valid_json
  - duplicate_detection: >90% similarity
  - completeness: all_required_fields
  - privacy_scan: no_identifiable_code
```

### Human Review
- Domain expertise verification
- Practical applicability assessment
- Documentation quality review
- Security implications analysis

### Continuous Validation
- Usage metrics tracking
- Feedback collection
- Pattern effectiveness monitoring
- Deprecation when outdated

## Incentive Structure

### Recognition Levels
1. **Contributor** - 1+ accepted patterns
2. **Reviewer** - 10+ quality reviews
3. **Expert** - 25+ contributions
4. **Maintainer** - Domain leadership

### Benefits
- Public attribution
- Early access to new patterns
- Influence on roadmap
- Conference speaking opportunities

## Governance

### Domain Committees
- 5-7 recognized experts
- Elected by contributors
- 1-year terms
- Responsible for quality standards

### Decision Making
- Simple patterns: 3 reviewer approval
- Complex patterns: Committee review
- Controversial: Community vote
- Appeals: Cross-domain panel

## Privacy & Security

### What We Never Store
- Source code
- Company names
- Project identifiers
- Personal information
- Proprietary algorithms

### What We Do Store
- Abstract patterns
- Statistical properties
- Performance metrics
- Community metadata

## Technical Implementation

### Submission Format
```json
{
  "pattern": {
    "name": "Retry with Exponential Backoff",
    "domain": "distributed-systems",
    "fingerprint": "hash_of_pattern_structure",
    "properties": {
      "fault-tolerance": "high",
      "latency": "variable",
      "complexity": "medium"
    },
    "metadata": {

## FAQ

**Q: Can I contribute anonymously?**
A: Yes, pseudonymous contributions are supported.

**Q: How are conflicts resolved?**
A: Through committee review and community voting.

**Q: Can patterns be updated?**
A: Yes, through versioned submissions.

**Q: What about intellectual property?**
A: Contributors retain rights; patterns are CC BY 4.0.

## Roadmap
