# Experiments Directory

## ⚠️ Status: Empty Placeholder

This directory is currently **empty** and exists only as a structural placeholder.

## Intended Purpose

This directory was meant to contain:
- Proof-of-concept code
- Experimental implementations
- Test scripts and data
- Research prototypes

## Current Reality

No experiments have been implemented. This reflects the current state of the project as a theoretical research endeavor without working code.

## Related Documentation

For theoretical experiments and research proposals, see:
- `/03-research-vision/experiments/` - Conceptual experiment designs
- `/reality-check/` - Honest assessment of why experiments haven't been built

## Contributing

We welcome:
- Proposals for experiments to validate concepts
- Discussion of experimental methodologies
- Theoretical analysis of proposed approaches

We cannot accept:
- Code contributions (no codebase exists)
- Experimental results (no experiments have been run)
