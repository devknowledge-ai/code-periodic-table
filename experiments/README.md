# Experiments Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains experimental research and proof-of-concept work supporting the Code Periodic Table project's long-term vision.

## Active Research Areas

### Pattern Analysis Experiments
- Testing pattern extraction algorithms
- Validating classification hypotheses
- Measuring pattern frequency and distribution
- Cross-language pattern correlation studies

### Machine Learning Models
- Training data preparation methods
- Model architecture experiments
- Performance benchmarking results
- Accuracy validation studies

### Performance Testing
- Scalability experiments
- Response time measurements
- Memory usage optimization
- Database query performance

## Research Status

**Phase 1 Validation**: âœ… Complete (85% confidence)
**Phase 2 Studies**: ðŸ”„ Ongoing (60% confidence)
**Phase 3 Research**: ðŸ”¬ Experimental (35% confidence)

## How to Contribute

1. Review existing experiments in subdirectories
2. Propose new hypotheses to test
3. Document failed experiments (equally valuable\!)
4. Share findings in discussions

## Important Note

This directory contains research work, not production code. Experiments here inform the specifications but are not intended for direct implementation.
