# AI Property Extraction Experiment

**Status: Active Research - 50% Success Probability**

## Overview

This experiment explores whether AI models can reliably extract semantic properties from code patterns. The goal is to automatically identify characteristics like performance, security, maintainability, and correctness from code structure.

## Research Question

Can machine learning models accurately extract and classify non-trivial properties of code patterns without executing them?

## Current Approach

### Model Architecture
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding
- Graph Neural Networks for structural analysis
- Hybrid approaches combining both

### Property Categories Being Tested

#### Performance Properties
- Time complexity estimation
- Space complexity analysis
- Resource usage patterns
- Scalability characteristics

#### Security Properties
- Vulnerability indicators
- Input validation presence
- Authentication patterns
- Data exposure risks

#### Quality Properties
- Maintainability scores
- Testability assessment
- Coupling and cohesion
- Code smell detection

## Experimental Results

### Current Accuracy Rates
| Property Type | Accuracy | Confidence |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Simple patterns | 75% | High |
| Performance | 60% | Medium |
| Security | 55% | Medium |
| Complex semantics | 40% | Low |
| Cross-language | 35% | Very Low |

### Key Findings
1. **Works well for**: Simple, well-defined properties
2. **Struggles with**: Context-dependent properties
3. **Requires**: Large training datasets
4. **Limited by**: Theoretical constraints (Rice's theorem)

## Methodology

### Data Collection
```python
# Training data structure
{
  "code_sample": "abstract_syntax_tree",
  "properties": {
    "performance": "O(n log n)",
    "security": ["input_validated", "sql_safe"],
    "maintainability": 7.5,
    "patterns": ["singleton", "factory"]
  },
  "validation": "human_verified"
}
```

### Model Training
- Dataset: 100K+ annotated code samples
- Validation: 80/20 split
- Cross-validation: 5-fold
- Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score

## Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Halting Problem** - Cannot determine all properties
2. **Context Sensitivity** - Properties depend on usage
3. **Training Data** - Limited high-quality annotations
4. **Generalization** - Models overfit to training languages

### Practical Challenges
1. **Annotation Cost** - Expensive to label data
2. **Validation Difficulty** - Hard to verify correctness
3. **Performance** - Inference too slow for real-time
4. **Interpretability** - Black box predictions

## Validation Approach

### Ground Truth
1. Human expert annotation
2. Static analysis comparison
3. Runtime verification (where possible)
4. Community consensus

### Metrics
```python
def evaluate_extraction(predicted, actual):
    return {
        'precision': true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives),
        'recall': true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives),
        'f1': harmonic_mean(precision, recall),
        'accuracy': correct / total
    }
```

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias Concerns
- Training data bias
- Language preference bias
- Quality judgment bias
- Corporate code bias

### Mitigation Strategies
