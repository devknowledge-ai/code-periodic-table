# Classification Working Group

**Status: Forming - Seeking Members**

## Mission

Develop and refine the classification system for code patterns, creating a practical and usable taxonomy that serves the developer community.

## Objectives

1. Define classification criteria
2. Create pattern taxonomy
3. Establish naming conventions
4. Validate classification system
5. Document classification methods

## Current Focus Areas

### Pattern Taxonomy Development
- Hierarchical structure design
- Category definitions
- Relationship mapping
- Property standardization

### Classification Criteria
- Objective measurements
- Subjective assessments
- Context considerations
- Evolution tracking

## Membership

### Current Members
- **Chair:** TBD
- **Vice-Chair:** TBD
- **Secretary:** TBD

### Seeking Experts In
- Software architecture
- Design patterns
- Programming language theory
- Taxonomy design
- Information science

## Meetings

**Schedule:** First Monday of each month
**Time:** TBD based on member availability
**Format:** Video conference with recorded notes
**Duration:** 1 hour

## Working Documents

### In Progress
- Classification criteria document
- Pattern property schema
- Naming convention guide
- Validation methodology

### Planned
- Pattern relationship ontology
- Cross-language mapping
- Evolution tracking system
- Quality metrics

## Decision Process

1. Proposal submission
2. Group discussion
3. Consensus building
4. Formal vote if needed
5. Documentation

## Current Debates

### Open Questions
- Should patterns be hierarchical or networked?
- How many classification levels?
- Language-specific vs. universal classification?
- How to handle pattern evolution?
