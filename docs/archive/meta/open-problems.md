# Open Research Problems

These are the fundamental questions we're exploring. Each represents a significant research opportunity with no known solution. Your insights, experiments, and even failed attempts help advance our understanding.

## üî¨ Fundamental Questions

### 1. Is Systematic Classification Even Possible?

**The Problem**: Code patterns might be too context-dependent, culturally specific, or rapidly evolving to classify systematically.

**Research Needed**:
- Statistical analysis of pattern stability over time
- Cross-cultural studies of programming practices
- Formal proofs of classification limits
- Empirical studies of pattern relationships

**Key Questions**:
- What percentage of code follows identifiable patterns?
- Do patterns have stable properties across contexts?
- Can we define pattern boundaries objectively?
- Is there a finite set of fundamental patterns?

**Why It's Hard**: Rice's theorem suggests semantic properties are undecidable. We need to identify which properties ARE decidable and useful.

### 2. Cross-Language Pattern Equivalence

**The Problem**: Determining when patterns in different languages are "the same" is non-trivial.

**Research Needed**:
- Formal definition of pattern equivalence
- Automated equivalence detection methods
- Empirical validation of equivalences
- Handling paradigm differences (OOP vs functional)

**Key Questions**:
- What makes two patterns semantically equivalent?
- How do we handle partial equivalence?
- Can equivalence be determined automatically?
- Do all patterns have cross-language equivalents?

**Current Blockers**: No agreed-upon definition of "semantic equivalence" for code patterns.

### 3. Optimal Classification Dimensions

**The Problem**: We don't know the best way to organize patterns - by purpose, structure, quality attributes, or something else.

**Research Needed**:
- Comparative studies of classification schemes
- User studies on mental models
- Information retrieval effectiveness
- Clustering analysis of natural groupings

**Key Questions**:
- What dimensions best capture pattern essence?
- How many dimensions are needed?
- Should classification be hierarchical or multi-dimensional?
- Do different domains need different dimensions?

**Challenge**: Multiple valid organizations exist with no clear "best" approach.

### 4. Pattern Property Extraction

**The Problem**: Automatically extracting meaningful properties from code is AI-hard.

**Research Needed**:
- Machine learning approaches
- Static analysis improvements
- Dynamic analysis integration
- Hybrid human-AI systems

**Key Questions**:
- Which properties can be extracted reliably?
- How do we handle ambiguous cases?
- Can we learn properties from usage patterns?
- What's the human-in-the-loop role?

**Technical Barriers**: Current static analysis hits fundamental limits; ML approaches lack explainability.

### 5. Evolution and Lifecycle

**The Problem**: Patterns evolve, merge, split, and die. How do we track this?

**Research Needed**:
- Longitudinal studies of pattern evolution
- Version control analysis
- Pattern genealogy methods
- Predictive models for pattern lifecycle

**Key Questions**:
- Can we predict pattern evolution?
- What causes patterns to become obsolete?
- How do new patterns emerge?
- Can we identify pattern precursors?

**Data Challenge**: Need historical data spanning decades across many projects.

**Open Problems**:
- Defining granularity levels objectively
- Handling patterns that span multiple levels
- Composability of fine-grained patterns
- Relationship between levels

### 7. Context Sensitivity

**Research Question**: How do we handle patterns whose meaning changes with context?

**Open Problems**:
- Formal model of context
- Context inference from code
- Pattern behavior in different contexts

### 8. Paradigm Boundaries

**Research Question**: Can we create a unified classification across programming paradigms?

**Open Problems**:
- Mapping between paradigm-specific concepts
- Handling paradigm-unique patterns

## üîß Technical Problems

### 9. Scalability of Analysis

**Research Question**: How can we analyze millions of codebases efficiently?

**Open Problems**:
- Incremental analysis algorithms
- Distributed processing strategies
- Approximation techniques
- Sampling methodologies

**Current State**: Full analysis of large codebases takes hours/days.

### 10. Semantic Fingerprinting Accuracy

**Research Question**: Can we achieve >90% accuracy in pattern recognition?

**Open Problems**:
- Optimal feature extraction
- Handling code variations
- Cross-language normalization
- Validation methodologies

**Current State**: ~70% accuracy on simple patterns, much lower on complex ones.

## üéØ Application Problems

### 11. Developer Mental Models

**Research Question**: How do developers naturally think about patterns?

**Research Needed**:
- Cognitive studies
- Ethnographic research
- Mental model elicitation

### 12. Value Quantification

**Research Question**: How do we measure the value of pattern classification?

**Open Problems**:
- Defining success metrics
- Measuring productivity impact
- Quantifying quality improvements
- ROI calculation methods

**Challenge**: Software development improvements are notoriously hard to measure.
