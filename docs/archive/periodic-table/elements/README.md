# Pattern Elements Catalog

**Status: Conceptual Framework - No Actual Elements Defined Yet**

## Overview

This directory will contain the individual "elements" of our code pattern periodic table. Unlike chemical elements with fixed properties, these are organizational units for pattern classification.

## Element Structure

Each pattern element would theoretically contain:

```yaml
element:
  id: "ELEM-001"
  symbol: "Sg"  # Short identifier
  name: "Singleton"
  category: "creational"
  properties:
    complexity: "low"
    frequency: "high"
    coupling: "global"
    testability: "low"
  relationships:
    combines_with: ["Factory", "Registry"]
    conflicts_with: ["Multiton"]
    evolves_to: ["Service Locator"]
  domains:
    applicable: ["all"]
    common_in: ["enterprise", "game-dev"]
    rare_in: ["functional"]
```

## Categories (Theoretical)

### Structural Elements
Patterns that define code structure:
- Layered Architecture
- Module Pattern
- Component Pattern
- Plugin Architecture

### Behavioral Elements
Patterns that define behavior:
- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- State Machine

### Creational Elements
Patterns for object creation:
- Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Data Elements
Patterns for data handling:
- Repository
- Data Mapper
- Active Record
- DTO/VO

### Concurrency Elements
Patterns for parallel execution:
- Producer-Consumer
- Thread Pool
- Async/Await
- Actor Model

## Why "Elements" is Misleading

**Important:** These are NOT like chemical elements because:
1. No fixed properties - Context changes everything
2. No atomic number - No natural ordering
3. Infinite variations - Not discrete units
4. Evolution - Patterns change over time
5. Subjective - No universal agreement

## Proposed Classification Dimensions

### By Abstraction Level
- Language-level (syntax patterns)
- Design-level (architectural patterns)
- System-level (distributed patterns)
- Domain-level (business patterns)

### By Problem Domain
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Maintainability improvement
- Scalability enhancement

### By Lifecycle Stage
- Greenfield patterns
- Refactoring patterns
- Migration patterns
- Deprecation patterns

## Metadata Schema

```json
{
  "element": {
    "identifier": {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "symbol": "2-3 letters",
      "name": "full name",
      "aliases": ["alternative names"]
    },
    "classification": {
      "category": "primary category",
      "subcategory": "specific type",
      "paradigm": ["OOP", "functional", "procedural"],
      "domain": ["web", "embedded", "ML"]
    },
    "properties": {
      "complexity": "low|medium|high",
      "performance": "impact description",
      "maintainability": "score",
      "reusability": "level"
    },
    "usage": {
      "frequency": "common|occasional|rare",
      "context": ["when to use"],
      "anti_contexts": ["when not to use"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Visualization Concepts

### Traditional Table Layout
```
[Cr] [St] [Bh] ...
[Sg] [Fc] [Bl] ...
[Rp] [Dm] [Ar] ...
```

### Network Graph
- Nodes = Elements
- Edges = Relationships
- Clusters = Categories
- Distance = Similarity

### 3D Space
- X-axis: Complexity
- Y-axis: Abstraction
- Z-axis: Domain
- Size: Frequency

## Challenges

### Classification Challenges
1. Patterns overlap and combine
2. Same pattern, different names
3. Context-dependent properties
4. Evolution over time
5. Cultural differences

### Practical Challenges
1. Who decides what's an "element"?
2. How to handle variants?
3. Update frequency?
4. Validation process?
5. Deprecation strategy?

## Future Work

### Phase 1: Catalog Existing Patterns
- Gang of Four patterns
- Enterprise patterns
- Domain-specific patterns
- Anti-patterns

### Phase 2: Discover New Patterns
- Mine open source
- Community contributions
- AI-assisted discovery
- Cross-domain analysis

### Phase 3: Organize and Classify
- Find relationships
- Build hierarchy
- Create visualizations
- Develop tools

## Contributing Elements

### Criteria for New Elements
1. Demonstrated use in multiple projects
2. Solves specific, recurring problem
3. Clear boundaries and definition
4. Not a variation of existing element
5. Community validation

### Submission Process
1. Propose element with evidence
2. Community discussion
3. Expert review
4. Trial period
5. Official adoption

## Reality Check

**Remember:** This is aspirational. We don't have a working periodic table of code. This structure is how we might organize patterns if the research succeeds.

**Status:** Waiting for pattern discovery and classification research to provide actual elements.
