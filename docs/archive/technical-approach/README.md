# Proposed Technical Approach for Validation

## Overview

This document outlines our proposed technical approaches for building Anvil. Each approach is presented as a hypothesis to be tested, with known challenges and mitigation strategies clearly documented.

## Core Technical Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: AST-Based Pattern Detection

**Proposal:** Use Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to detect code patterns independent of formatting and naming.

**Proposed Implementation:**
```python
# Conceptual approach - requires validation
def detect_pattern(code_ast):
    # Normalize AST structure
    normalized = remove_naming_variations(code_ast)
    # Generate semantic fingerprint
    fingerprint = create_semantic_hash(normalized)
    # Match against known patterns
    return pattern_database.find_similar(fingerprint)
```

**Challenges & Mitigation:**

| Challenge | Current State | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Performance (target <100ms) | Unknown, likely slow initially | Incremental parsing, caching |
| Cross-language support | Very difficult | Start with single language |
| AST normalization | Complex problem | Focus on structural similarity |
| Memory usage | May explode on large files | Streaming parser, file chunking |

**Validation Plan:**
1. Build prototype for Python only
2. Test on 100 open-source projects
3. Measure accuracy and performance
4. Iterate on algorithm

### Hypothesis 2: Git History Mining

**Proposal:** Extract patterns from git commit history to identify repeated mistakes.

**Approach:**
- Analyze bug fix commits (containing "fix", "bug", "error")
- Extract before/after code patterns
- Build database of mistake signatures
- Warn when similar patterns detected

**Challenges & Mitigation:**

| Challenge | Current State | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Signal-to-noise ratio | Very low (~10% useful) | Advanced filtering, ML classification |
| Commit message quality | Highly variable | Multiple signal combination |
| Merge commit pollution | Significant noise | Exclude merges, focus on direct commits |
| Rebase/squash history | Information loss | Work with available history |

**Validation Metrics:**
- Precision: % of warnings that are actual issues
- Recall: % of issues we catch
- Target: >70% precision, >50% recall

### Hypothesis 3: Semantic Fingerprinting

**Proposal:** Create stable identifiers for code blocks that survive refactoring.

**Conceptual Algorithm:**
```
fingerprint = hash(
    structure_weight * structural_features +
    dataflow_weight * dataflow_features +
    control_weight * control_flow_features +
    semantic_weight * semantic_features
)
```

**Challenges & Mitigation:**

| Challenge | Current State | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Refactoring resistance | Untested | Multi-feature approach |
| Collision rate | Unknown | Use 256-bit hashes |
| Feature extraction | Complex | Start with simple features |
| Update efficiency | Could be slow | Incremental computation |

**Success Criteria:**
- 85%+ tracking accuracy through common refactorings
- <1% false match rate
- <50ms computation time

**Known Architectural Risks:**

1. **Monolithic Design Risk**
   - Problem: Could become unmaintainable
   - Mitigation: Modular plugin architecture

2. **Performance Bottleneck**
   - Problem: Sequential processing too slow
   - Mitigation: Parallel analysis pipeline

3. **Memory Constraints**
   - Problem: Large repos could exhaust RAM
   - Mitigation: Streaming processing, disk-based cache

## Data Models

### Pattern Representation

```typescript
interface Pattern {
  id: string;
  fingerprint: string;
  type: PatternType;
  confidence: number;
  
  // Challenges with this model:
  // - How to handle pattern evolution?
  // - How to merge similar patterns?
  // - How to weight confidence?
  
  metadata: {
    firstSeen: Date;
    lastSeen: Date;
    frequency: number;
    falsePositives: number;
  };
}
```

### Knowledge Graph Structure

**Hypothesis:** Team knowledge can be represented as a graph.

**Proposed Structure:**
- Nodes: Code entities, patterns, developers, commits
- Edges: Relationships (created, modified, similar-to, fixes)

**Challenges:**
- Graph size explosion (mitigation: pruning, summarization)
- Query performance (mitigation: graph database, indexing)
- Relationship inference (mitigation: conservative approach)

## Performance Requirements & Reality

### Target Performance (Aspirational)

| Operation | Target | Current Reality | Path to Target |

| Pattern matching | <50ms | Unknown | Caching, indexing |
| Git mining | <5s/repo | Unknown | Incremental processing |
| IDE response | <200ms | Unknown | Background processing |

### Scalability Challenges

**Large Repositories (>100K files):**
- Problem: Initial scan could take hours
- Mitigation: Incremental analysis, prioritization

**Deep History (>10K commits):**

## Conclusion

This technical approach represents our best current hypothesis for building Anvil. Every component faces significant challenges, and success is not guaranteed. However, by clearly documenting these challenges and our mitigation strategies, we can approach development systematically and pivot quickly when approaches fail.

The key to success will be rapid prototyping, honest measurement, and willingness to abandon approaches that don't work.
