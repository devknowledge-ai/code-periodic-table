# Foundations Directory

## Purpose

This directory will contain the foundational implementation components for the Code Periodic Table system once development begins.

## Planned Content

### Knowledge Graph Implementation
- Graph database schema and models
- Pattern storage and retrieval algorithms
- Relationship mapping between code patterns
- Query optimization strategies

### Semantic Fingerprinting Engine
- Pattern extraction algorithms
- Fingerprint generation methods
- Cross-language pattern matching
- Similarity scoring systems

### VS Code Integration Layer
- Extension architecture implementation
- Real-time pattern detection
- UI/UX components for pattern feedback
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Vulnerability Detection Framework
- Security pattern recognition
- CVE database integration
- Risk assessment algorithms
- Alert and reporting systems

## Current Status

**Documentation**: ✅ Complete specifications available in parent directories
**Implementation**: ⏳ Awaiting development resources

## Getting Started

When implementation begins, this directory will contain:
1. Core libraries and modules
2. Unit and integration tests
3. Performance benchmarks
4. API implementations

## Contributing

Review the complete specifications in the /01-immediate-value/ directory to understand the planned architecture before implementation begins.
