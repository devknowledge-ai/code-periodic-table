# Periodic Table Directory

## ⚠️ Status: Empty Placeholder

This directory was intended to contain implementations of the periodic table visualization and element definitions. However, **no implementation exists**.

## What Was Planned

### `/elements/`
Would have contained:
- Pattern element definitions
- Property specifications
- Classification data
- Relationship mappings

### `/visualization/`
Would have contained:
- Interactive periodic table UI
- Pattern browsing interface
- Search and filter tools
- Visual relationship diagrams

## Current State

Both subdirectories are **completely empty**. This reflects the reality that the Code Periodic Table is currently a research concept without any implementation.

## Why These Directories Exist

They remain as placeholders to show the intended structure if the project were to be implemented. They serve as documentation of what was envisioned, not what exists.

## What You Can Do

If you're interested in this concept:
1. Review the theoretical framework in `/03-research-vision/`
2. Read the honest assessment in `/reality-check/`
3. Contribute to research discussions via GitHub Issues

**Note**: There is no code to contribute to, test, or use in these directories.
