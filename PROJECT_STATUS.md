# Project Status Dashboard

**Last Updated:** 2025 | **You Are Here:** 🔬 Research & Design Phase

## Quick Status Overview

### The Anvil Project (Core Product)
🟡 **Status:** Seeking funding to begin development
- ✅ Problem validated
- ✅ Technical approach designed  
- ✅ Architecture documented
- ⏳ Awaiting resources for prototype
- ❌ No code written yet

### Research Horizon (Long-term Vision)
🔵 **Status:** Parallel research track
- Active hypothesis formation
- No timeline until Anvil validates approach
- 20-35% probability of eventual success

## What This Project Actually Is

### It IS:
✅ A research program with a practical focus (Anvil tool)  
✅ Comprehensive documentation of approach  
✅ Transparent about challenges and risks  
✅ Seeking funding and contributors  

### It is NOT:
❌ A working product  
❌ Proven technology  
❌ Ready for implementation without validation  
❌ Guaranteed to succeed  

## Development Phases & Probabilities

| Phase | Description | Status | Success Probability | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Anvil Core** | Team knowledge tool | Design complete, awaiting funding | 60-70% | 12-18 months |
| **Pattern Sharing** | Cross-team learning | Conceptual only | 40-50% | Years 2-3 (if Anvil succeeds) |
| **Universal Classification** | "Periodic table" | Research vision | 20-35% | Years 3+ (if prior phases succeed) |

**Overall Project Success:** ~35% (achieving full vision)

## Current Priorities

### Next 3 Months
1. 🎯 **Secure Funding**
   - [ ] Submit NSF SBIR application
   - [ ] Contact potential sponsors
   - [ ] Establish university partnerships

2. 🔨 **Begin Anvil Prototype**
   - [ ] Python-only proof of concept
   - [ ] Basic pattern detection
   - [ ] Test on 10 repositories

3. 🧪 **Validate Core Hypotheses**
   - [ ] Mistake repetition frequency
   - [ ] Pattern detection accuracy
   - [ ] Performance feasibility

## Resource Requirements

### Minimum Viable Team
- 1 developer/researcher (6 months)
- $125K budget
- Part-time advisors

### Optimal Team
- 2-3 developers/researchers (12 months)
- $500K budget
- Dedicated infrastructure
- Community manager

## Key Metrics to Track

### Technical Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Pattern Detection Accuracy | Unknown | 80%+ | 🔄 To be tested |
| False Positive Rate | Unknown | <10% | 🔄 To be tested |
| Analysis Speed | Unknown | <100ms/file | 🔄 To be tested |
| Memory Usage | Unknown | <2GB | 🔄 To be tested |

### Adoption Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Active Contributors | 1 | 20+ | 🔴 Need growth |
| Test Repositories | 0 | 50+ | 🔴 Need partners |
| User Feedback | None | NPS >30 | ⏳ Awaiting users |
| GitHub Stars | ~10 | 1000+ | 🔴 Need awareness |

## Risk Register

### 🔴 High Risks
1. **Technical Infeasibility** (40% probability)
   - Pattern detection accuracy too low
   - Mitigation: Multiple algorithm approaches

2. **Funding Shortage** (50% probability)
   - Grants rejected, no sponsors
   - Mitigation: Multiple funding sources

### 🟡 Medium Risks
1. **Slow Adoption** (60% probability)
   - Developers skeptical of value
   - Mitigation: Focus on clear wins

2. **Competition** (40% probability)
   - AI tools solve problem differently
   - Mitigation: Focus on team-specific learning

## How to Interpret This Project

### For Potential Contributors
- **Engineers:** Help build Anvil (practical tool)
- **Researchers:** Explore pattern classification (research)
- **Skeptics:** Challenge our assumptions (valuable!)

### For Potential Funders
- **Research Grants:** Fund fundamental CS research
- **Open Source Sponsors:** Support practical tool development
- **Angels/VCs:** Too early, revisit if Anvil succeeds

### For Potential Users
- **Current:** Nothing to use yet, provide feedback on concept
- **6 months:** Alpha testing opportunities
- **12 months:** Beta version available

## FAQ

**Q: When will there be something to use?**
A: 12-18 months if funding secured in next 3 months.

**Q: What's the highest risk?**
A: Technical feasibility - pattern detection might not reach usable accuracy.

**Q: Why should I contribute?**
A: Shape a tool that could transform how teams preserve knowledge.

**Q: Is this another AI hype project?**
A: No. This is classical pattern recognition with realistic goals.
