# Project Status: Single Source of Truth

## Current State: Active Research Program

### üî¨ What This Project Is
An **active research program** exploring whether systematic code pattern classification can improve software development. This repository contains theoretical frameworks, architectural proposals, and experimental designs - not a working product.

### üìä What Exists vs. What Doesn't

#### ‚úÖ What Currently Exists:
- Comprehensive research documentation
- Theoretical architectural proposals  
- Proposed technical approaches
- Hypothesis framework for testing
- Community collaboration structure
- Transparent documentation of challenges

#### ‚ùå What Does NOT Exist:
- Working implementation
- Validated accuracy metrics
- Performance measurements
- Production-ready code
- Proven pattern detection algorithms
- Scalable system architecture

### üéØ Current Research Phase
**Phase:** Early-stage exploration and hypothesis formation
**Status:** Documentation and theoretical design
**Next Step:** Secure resources for experimental validation

## Success Probability Assessment

**See [STATE_OF_HYPOTHESES.md](STATE_OF_HYPOTHESES.md) for detailed probability assessments**

### Summary:
- **Overall Project Success:** ~35% probability
- **Phase 1 (Local Learning):** 60-70% probability  
- **Phase 2 (Community Platform):** 40-50% probability (contingent on Phase 1)
- **Phase 3 (Universal Classification):** 20-35% probability

## Research Questions Under Investigation

### Primary Questions (Phase 1 Focus):
1. Can we reliably detect patterns in team-specific code?
2. Is 80%+ accuracy achievable for local pattern recognition?
3. Will teams adopt tools that learn from their history?
4. Can performance meet real-time analysis requirements?

### Secondary Questions (Future Phases):
- Can patterns be shared across teams effectively?
- Do universal code patterns exist across languages?
- Is automated pattern classification scalable?

## Timeline & Resources

### Current Phase (Research & Design)
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Activities:** 
- Documenting hypotheses
- Designing experiments
- Building research community
- Seeking funding/resources

### Next Phase (Experimental Validation) 
**Duration:** 12-18 months (once resources secured)
**Required Resources:**
- 2-3 researchers/developers
- $200-500K funding
- Access to diverse codebases
- Computational resources for experiments

### Future Phases
See [COMMERCIALIZATION_PATH.md](COMMERCIALIZATION_PATH.md) for speculative commercial path (contingent on research success)

## How to Interpret This Project

### For Researchers
This is an opportunity to explore fundamental questions in software engineering. Join us in investigating whether code patterns can be systematically classified and whether this classification provides value.

### For Potential Contributors  
We need help validating hypotheses, designing experiments, and challenging assumptions. Technical implementation will begin only after core hypotheses are validated.

### For Funders
This is high-risk, high-reward research. Fund only if you:
- Support fundamental software engineering research
- Accept significant probability of failure
- Value negative results as learning
- Have patience for long-term outcomes

### For Skeptics
Your skepticism is valuable. Help us:
- Identify flaws in our approach
- Find theoretical limitations
- Design better experiments
- Fail fast if we're wrong
