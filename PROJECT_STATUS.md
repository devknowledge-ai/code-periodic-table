# Project Status: What Actually Exists

*Last Updated: December 2024*

## The Truth About Code Status

Following our principle of **radical honesty**, here's exactly what exists and what doesn't.

## ‚úÖ What EXISTS

### Documentation & Planning
- **The Great Simplification story** - Complete pivot documentation
- **Vision and roadmap** - Clear direction for the project
- **Tool specifications** - Detailed plans for each tool
- **Partnership strategy** - Approach for AI tool integration
- **Contributing guides** - How to get involved

### Foundation Code
- **anvil-core structure** - Directory layout and basic setup.py
- **Project scaffolding** - Directory structure for each tool
- **README files** - Documentation for each component

## ‚ùå What DOES NOT EXIST

### No Working Code
- **No functional tools** - None of the Anvil tools work yet
- **No pip packages** - Cannot `pip install` any Anvil tools
- **No working demos** - All demos are conceptual/planned
- **No IDE integrations** - VSCode/IntelliJ plugins don't exist
- **No web interfaces** - No live websites or web apps

### Specific Non-Existent Items
- `pip install anvil-guard` - **DOES NOT WORK**
- `pip install anvil-preview` - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- `nullguard check` command - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- `anvil analyze` command - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Web demo at any URL - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- GitHub repo with demo code - **DOES NOT EXIST**

## üöß What's IN DEVELOPMENT

### NullGuard Prototype (Priority #1)
- **Status**: Planning phase
- **Timeline**: 4-week prototype plan created
- **Goal**: 70% accuracy demonstration
- See [PROTOTYPE.md](./projects/null-guard/PROTOTYPE.md)

### Adaptive Documentation (Critical Path)
- **Status**: Partnership strategy defined
- **Next Step**: Contact AI tool maintainers
- See [PARTNERSHIP_TRACKER.md](./PARTNERSHIP_TRACKER.md)

## üìÖ Realistic Timeline

### Next 1 Month
- [ ] Contact first AI tool partner (Aider)
- [ ] Build NullGuard prototype core
- [ ] Achieve 70% accuracy on test cases

### Next 3 Months
- [ ] One AI tool integration working
- [ ] NullGuard demo website live
- [ ] First contributors joining

### Next 6 Months
- [ ] Multiple AI tool partnerships
- [ ] NullGuard reaches 80% accuracy
- [ ] Other tools in early development

## How to Help

### If You Want Working Code
**This project isn't for you yet.** Check back in 3-6 months.

### If You Want to Build Something New
**Perfect!** Pick a tool and start implementing:
1. Start with [NullGuard](./projects/null-guard/) - our showcase
2. Or help with [Adaptive Documentation](./projects/adaptive-documentation/) partnerships
3. Or build [Anvil Context](./projects/anvil-context/) from scratch

### If You Want to Contribute Ideas
- Review and improve documentation
- Suggest implementation approaches
- Help with partnership outreach

## Why This Honesty Matters

We learned from our mistakes:
1. **Fictional demos confuse contributors**
2. **Pretending things exist wastes everyone's time**
3. **Honesty builds trust and attracts the right people**

## The Bottom Line

**We have great ideas and solid plans, but no working code yet.**

If you're excited about building something from scratch with a clear vision and honest communication, join us.

If you need working tools today, this isn't ready for you.
