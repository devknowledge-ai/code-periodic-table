# Domain Patterns Repository

**Status: Framework Design - Pattern Libraries in Development**

## Overview

This directory organizes patterns by specific domains, recognizing that different fields have unique requirements, conventions, and best practices. Each domain maintains its own pattern library with specialized validation and contribution processes.

## Available Domains

### [Web Development](./web-dev/)
Frontend, backend, and full-stack patterns for modern web applications.
- **Focus:** Performance, accessibility, user experience
- **Frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular, Node.js
- **Patterns:** ~200 expected

### [Machine Learning](./machine-learning/)
Patterns for ML pipelines, model development, and MLOps.
- **Focus:** Data pipelines, training, deployment
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Patterns:** ~150 expected

### [Security](./security/)
Defensive security patterns for secure software development.
- **Focus:** Vulnerability prevention, authentication, encryption
- **Standards:** OWASP, CWE, NIST
- **Patterns:** ~100 expected

### [Embedded Systems](./embedded-systems/)
Resource-constrained and real-time system patterns.
- **Focus:** Memory management, real-time constraints, hardware abstraction
- **Platforms:** ARM, AVR, RISC-V
- **Patterns:** ~120 expected

## Why Domain-Specific?

### Domain Expertise Matters
- Patterns that work in web development may fail in embedded systems
- Security requirements vary drastically between domains
- Performance means different things in different contexts

### Specialized Validation
Each domain has its own:
- Review criteria
- Testing requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Quality standards

### Community Focus
- Domain experts review domain patterns
- Specialized knowledge stays relevant
- Reduced noise from unrelated patterns

## Pattern Classification

### Cross-Domain Patterns
Some patterns apply across multiple domains:
- Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer)
- Architectural patterns (MVC, Layered, Event-driven)
- General algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Caching)

### Domain-Specific Patterns
Unique to particular fields:
- **Web:** Virtual DOM, SSR, Progressive Enhancement
- **ML:** Feature Engineering, Model Serving, Data Augmentation
- **Security:** Input Sanitization, Secure Session Management
- **Embedded:** Interrupt Handling, Power Management, RTOS patterns

## Contribution Process

### 1. Choose Your Domain
Select the domain that best matches your pattern.

### 2. Check Existing Patterns
Avoid duplicates by searching existing patterns.

### 3. Follow Domain Guidelines
Each domain has specific requirements:
- Naming conventions
- Documentation standards
- Testing requirements
- Performance criteria

### 4. Submit for Review
Domain experts will review your contribution.

## Quality Standards

### Universal Requirements
All patterns must:
- Solve a real, recurring problem
- Be well-documented
- Include examples
- Consider trade-offs
- Respect privacy

### Domain-Specific Requirements
Additional criteria per domain:
- **Web:** Browser compatibility, accessibility
- **ML:** Reproducibility, bias consideration
- **Security:** Threat model, compliance
- **Embedded:** Resource usage, determinism

## Pattern Format

```yaml
pattern:
  # Metadata
  id: DOMAIN-CATEGORY-###
  name: Pattern Name
  domain: specific-domain
  category: subcategory
  
  # Description
  problem: What problem does this solve?
  solution: How does the pattern solve it?
  context: When should this be used?
  
  # Properties
  complexity: low|medium|high
  performance: impact description
  security: considerations
  
  # Examples
  examples:
    - language: implementation language
      code: example implementation
  
  # Relationships
  related_patterns: []
  alternatives: []
  anti_patterns: []
```

## Cross-Domain Learning

### Pattern Migration
Successful patterns from one domain may inspire solutions in another:
- Web's component model → UI patterns in embedded
- ML's pipeline patterns → Data processing in web
- Security's defense-in-depth → Reliability in embedded

### Shared Knowledge
- Common algorithmic approaches
- Architectural principles
- Performance optimization techniques
- Testing strategies

## Domain Evolution

### Adding New Domains
Criteria for new domain addition:
1. Sufficient unique patterns (>50)
2. Active community (>20 contributors)
3. Clear boundaries
4. Specialized requirements
5. Community vote approval

### Planned Domains
- **Cloud Native:** Kubernetes, microservices, serverless
- **Mobile Development:** iOS, Android, React Native
- **Data Engineering:** ETL, streaming, warehousing
- **Game Development:** Graphics, physics, networking
- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts, consensus, DeFi

## Governance

### Domain Committees
Each domain has:
- 3-5 domain experts
- Elected annually
- Responsible for quality
- Review process ownership

### Cross-Domain Council
- Representatives from each domain
- Coordinate shared patterns
- Resolve boundary disputes
- Maintain consistency
