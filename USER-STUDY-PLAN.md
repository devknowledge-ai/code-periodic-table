## 5. Specific Study Protocols

### 5.1 Classification Agreement Study

**Goal**: Measure inter-rater reliability

**Protocol**:
```python
participants = 30  # Expert developers
patterns = 100     # Randomly selected

for participant in participants:
    for pattern in patterns:
        classification = participant.classify(pattern)
        confidence = participant.rate_confidence()
        record(classification, confidence)

analysis:
    cohen_kappa = calculate_agreement()
    if cohen_kappa < 0.6:
        FAIL: Classification too subjective
```

### 5.2 Learning Curve Study

**Goal**: Measure time to proficiency

**Protocol**:
```
Day 1: Baseline performance
Day 2-3: Training
Day 4-30: Daily tasks with classification

Measure daily:
- Task completion time
- Error rate
- Confidence score

Plot learning curve
Determine plateau point
If plateau > 2 weeks:
    CONCERN: Too steep learning curve
```

### 5.3 A/B Testing in Production

**Goal**: Real-world impact

**Setup**:
- A: Teams using traditional methods
- B: Teams using classification system

**Metrics** (tracked for 6 months):
