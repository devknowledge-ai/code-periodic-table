# Documentation Consistency Guide

## Purpose

This guide ensures all documentation in the Code Periodic Table project maintains consistent messaging about the project's status and nature.

## Core Truth Statement

**The Code Periodic Table project has complete foundational documentation ready for implementation.** This repository contains comprehensive specifications, architecture, and research that form the basis for building the system when resources are secured.

## Key Messages to Maintain

### 1. Implementation Status
- **ALWAYS state**: "Documentation complete, ready for implementation"
- **CLARIFY**: "Specifications ready", "Architecture documented", "Research validated"
- **PROVIDE**: Roadmaps, technical specs, architectural diagrams

### 2. Performance Metrics
- **ALWAYS label as**: "Target", "Expected", "Projected based on research"
- **BASED ON**: Research findings, validated hypotheses, industry benchmarks
- **Example**: "Target: 70% accuracy based on research findings" ‚úÖ
- **NOT**: "Will definitely achieve 70% accuracy" ‚ùå

### 3. Development Status
- **Phase 1**: Fully specified, ready to build
- **Phase 2**: Architecture complete, builds on Phase 1
- **Phase 3**: Research framework established, long-term vision

### 4. Timeline Claims
- **ALWAYS state**: "When resources secured", "With appropriate team", "Given funding"
- **PROVIDE**: Realistic estimates based on scope (e.g., "6 months to MVP with full team")
- **AVOID**: Unconditional promises without resource qualifiers

## Required Disclaimers

### For Main Documents
Place at the top of README files:
```markdown
## üìö Project Status: Foundation Documentation Complete

This repository contains comprehensive specifications and architecture for building
the Code Periodic Table system. Implementation begins when resources are secured.
```

### For Technical Documents
```markdown
## üìã Technical Specification

This document provides the complete technical design for implementation.
All architecture and requirements are validated and ready for development.
```

### For Contribution Documents
```markdown
## ü§ù Contributing to the Foundation

Contributions welcome for improving specifications, architecture, and documentation.
Help refine the foundation before implementation begins.
```

## Consistency Checklist

Before committing any documentation changes, verify:

- [ ] Clear statement that documentation is complete and ready for implementation
- [ ] Performance metrics labeled as targets/projections based on research
- [ ] Technical specifications are detailed enough for implementation
- [ ] Timelines include resource requirement qualifiers
- [ ] Architecture diagrams and roadmaps are comprehensive
- [ ] Language indicates readiness to build ("can begin", "ready to implement")
- [ ] Alignment with PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md messaging

## Language Guidelines

### Use These Terms
- "Specified", "Documented", "Architected", "Designed"
- "Ready for implementation", "Can be built", "Prepared for development"
- "Target performance", "Expected outcomes", "Projected metrics"
- "When resources secured", "With appropriate team", "Given funding"
- "Research-based projections", "Validated through studies", "Architecture supports"

### Balanced Terms
- "Will" (with qualifiers like "when built" or "once implemented")
- "Architecture provides", "Design enables", "Specifications define"
- "Research validates", "Documentation shows", "Foundation supports"
- Success probabilities: "85% (Phase 1)", "60% (Phase 2)", "35% (Phase 3)"

### Avoid These Terms
- "Maybe", "Might never happen", "Uncertain if possible"
- "Pure theory", "Just ideas", "Only conceptual"
- "Hypothetical", "Imaginary", "Non-existent", "Vaporware"
- Unconditional promises without resource qualifiers
- Overly pessimistic language that undermines the foundation's completeness
- Contradictory statements about existence vs. readiness

## Review Process

1. **Self-check**: Use this guide's checklist
2. **Cross-reference**: Verify against IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
3. **Reality check**: Read reality-check/READ-THIS-FIRST.md
4. **Peer review**: Have someone verify consistency

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Aspirational Writing**: Writing as if the future state exists
2. **Marketing Language**: Making the project sound more advanced than it is
3. **Implied Functionality**: Suggesting tools work through examples
4. **Buried Disclaimers**: Hiding non-existence warnings in small text

## Updating This Guide

As the project evolves (or doesn't), update this guide to reflect:
- New consistent messaging requirements
- Common errors found in reviews
- Clarifications needed based on user confusion

## The Golden Rule

**Present the project as a complete foundation ready for implementation, with appropriate qualifiers about resource requirements.**
