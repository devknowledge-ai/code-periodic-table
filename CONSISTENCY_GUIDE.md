# Documentation Honesty Guide

## Purpose

This guide ensures all documentation in the Code Periodic Table project maintains **radical honesty** about the project's experimental nature and high probability of failure.

## Core Truth Statement

**The Code Periodic Table is an experimental research project with a 65% probability of failure.** We have theoretical frameworks and early research explorations, extensive documentation, and no production-ready implementation. We don't know if our core hypotheses are achievable.

## Required Honest Messaging

### 1. Implementation Status
- **ALWAYS state**: "Theoretical framework only, no validated accuracy metrics"
- **CLARIFY**: "No production implementation exists"
- **ACKNOWLEDGE**: "Core feasibility questions remain unanswered"

### 2. Performance Claims
- **ALWAYS distinguish**: "Current: No validated metrics" vs "Target: To be determined" vs "Hope: 80-90%"
- **NEVER present**: Targets as achievements
- **INCLUDE**: "May be theoretically impossible to achieve"

### 3. Development Reality
- **Phase 1**: Theoretical concepts being researched
- **Phase 2**: Depends on Phase 1 not failing
- **Phase 3**: Probably impossible (< 20% success probability)

### 4. Timeline Honesty
- **ALWAYS include**: "If research succeeds (unlikely)"
- **REALISTIC**: "3+ years minimum, if ever"
- **DEFAULT**: "Project may be abandoned before completion"

## Required Disclaimers

### For ALL Documents
```markdown
⚠️ **Research Warning**: This is experimental research with a high probability of failure.
Current status: Theoretical framework. No production implementation exists.
```

### For Technical Documents
```markdown
## 🔬 Theoretical Specification

This document describes our research hypotheses, not validated approaches.
These ideas may prove incorrect or impossible to implement effectively.
```

### For Contribution Documents
```markdown
## 🤝 Contributing to Research

Help us explore these difficult problems and document what doesn't work.
Your contributions may lead to valuable negative results.
```

## Honesty Checklist

Before committing any documentation:

- [ ] Clearly state current research status and limitations
- [ ] Include probability of failure (65% overall)
- [ ] Distinguish research ideas from proven approaches
- [ ] Acknowledge theoretical limits (Rice's Theorem, etc.)
- [ ] Avoid implying readiness or completeness
- [ ] Include "might fail" language where appropriate
- [ ] Reference reality-check/ documents

## Language Guidelines

### MUST Use These Terms
- "Experimental", "Unproven", "Theoretical", "Hypothetical"
- "May fail", "Probably won't work", "Uncertain if possible"
- "Research prototype", "Not production-ready", "Conceptual"
- "No validated performance metrics", "Theoretical framework only", "Unproven at scale"
- "High probability of failure", "Fundamental challenges", "Unsolved problems"

### ENCOURAGE Skeptical Language
- "We don't know if this will work"
- "Previous attempts have failed"
- "May be theoretically impossible"
- "Skeptics are probably right"
- "Join us in documenting failure"

### AVOID False Confidence
- "Ready for implementation" (when it's not)
- "Foundation complete" (it's research ideas)
- "Validated" (by our own circular reasoning)
- "Will achieve" (we hope to achieve)
- "Professional", "Enterprise-ready", "Production-quality"

## The Skeptic's Section

Every major document should include:
1. Why this probably won't work
2. What we've tried that failed
3. Fundamental limits we can't overcome
4. Links to reality-check/ directory

## Common Honesty Failures to Avoid

1. **The Confidence Trap**: Acting certain when we're guessing
2. **The Readiness Illusion**: Claiming completeness for incomplete work
3. **The Projection Trick**: Presenting hopes as plans
4. **The Validation Circle**: Using our own research to prove our own ideas

## Examples of Honest Documentation

### Bad (Dishonest)
"Our complete architecture enables 80% pattern recognition accuracy."

### Good (Honest)
"We hope our proposed architecture might achieve effective pattern recognition, though current research is purely theoretical and we may encounter fundamental limits."

### Bad (Misleading)
"Phase 1 specifications are ready for implementation."

### Good (Truthful)
"Phase 1 contains our research hypotheses that need validation through experimentation. They may prove unworkable."

## When Positivity is Appropriate

You CAN be positive about:
- The value of the research question
- The quality of our documentation effort
- The potential impact IF it worked
- The learning value even in failure
- The community's enthusiasm

## The Golden Rule

**When in doubt, err on the side of pessimism. It's better to under-promise and over-deliver than to mislead contributors about our current reality.**

## Enforcement

This guide supersedes any previous consistency guides that encouraged false confidence. If you see documentation violating these principles:
1. Flag it immediately
2. Rewrite it to be honest
3. Add appropriate warnings
4. Link to reality-check/
