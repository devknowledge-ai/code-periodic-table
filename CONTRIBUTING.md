## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/code-periodic-table.git
cd code-periodic-table
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# For Python components
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

### 3. Find Something to Work On

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/[org]/code-periodic-table/issues)
- Look for `good first issue` labels
- Read through TODO comments in code
- Propose your own improvements

### 4. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üìù Development Process

### 1. Before You Start

- Check if an issue already exists for your idea
- Discuss major changes in an issue first
- For research contributions, share your approach early

### 2. Making Changes

- Write clear, commented code
- Follow existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed

Fixes #123
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `research`: Research-related additions

### 4. Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a Pull Request against `main`
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Link related issues
5. Wait for review and address feedback

### 5. Pull Request Guidelines

**Your PR should:**
