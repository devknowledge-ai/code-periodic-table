# Contributing to The Anvil Project

Welcome! We're building something ambitiousâ€”a tool that preserves team knowledge and a vision for organizing all programming knowledge. There's a place for everyone here, from pragmatic builders to visionary thinkers.

## Quick Start

### ðŸ”¨ "I want to build"
â†’ Start in `/anvil` - Build the practical tool that helps teams today

### ðŸ”¬ "I want to research"  
â†’ Explore `/research` - Test hypotheses and run experiments

### ðŸ’­ "I want to think"
â†’ Dive into `/vision` - Explore and refine the theoretical framework

### ðŸ¤” "I want to challenge"
â†’ Read `/research/open-questions.md` - Help us identify what we're missing

2. Explore `/vision/periodic-table-metaphor.md`
3. Share thoughts in Discussions
4. Join our Discord's #theory channel

### For Skeptics

**Focus Area**: Everywhere

Keep us grounded:
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Point out flaws in our logic
- **Reality Checks**: Identify practical limitations
- **Alternative Approaches**: Suggest better solutions
- **Devil's Advocate**: Argue against our hypotheses

**Skills Needed**:
- Critical thinking
- Industry experience
- Honest communication
- Constructive criticism

**Getting Started**:
1. Read our claims critically
2. Document concerns in Issues
3. Propose alternatives
4. Join our Discord's #reality-check channel

## Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start

- **Read the Vision**: Understand what we're building and why
- **Check Existing Work**: See if someone's already working on it
- **Discuss First**: For major changes, open an Issue first
- **Join the Community**: Our Discord is where coordination happens

### 2. Making Changes

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/code-periodic-table
cd code-periodic-table

# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... 

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "feat: add pattern detection for X"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Pull Request Guidelines

**Title Format**: `type: brief description`
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation
- `research:` Research findings
- `theory:` Theoretical contributions

**PR Description Should Include**:
- What changes you made
- Why you made them
- How to test them
- Any open questions

### 4. Code Review Process

- All PRs need at least one review
- Address feedback constructively
- Tests must pass (when we have them)
- Documentation must be updated
