# Contributing to the Code Periodic Table Project

Welcome! We're excited you're interested in contributing to the Code Periodic Table project. This is a **community experiment** exploring whether programming patterns can be systematically classified - and we need diverse perspectives to find out!

**üéØ Your skepticism is as valuable as your enthusiasm!** We're exploring uncharted territory and need people who will challenge assumptions, test hypotheses, and help us learn from failures.
