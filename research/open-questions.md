# Open Research Questions

*The testable hypotheses and challenges we're actively investigating*

## Core Hypotheses Under Investigation

### Hypothesis 1: Pattern Detectability
**Question**: Can we reliably detect when teams are about to repeat past mistakes?

**What We're Testing**:
- Git history contains sufficient signal to identify pattern repetition
- Semantic analysis can match similar code despite syntactic differences
- Warning accuracy can exceed 70% with <20% false positives

**Current Experiments**:
- Analyzing open-source projects with known bug fixes
- Testing pattern matching across refactored code
- Measuring developer response to warnings

**Success Criteria**: 
- Detection accuracy >70%
- False positive rate <20%
- Developer acceptance >60%

### Hypothesis 2: Context Preservation
**Question**: Can semantic linking preserve context through refactoring?

**What We're Testing**:
- Comments can be linked to code meaning, not just location
- Semantic links survive common refactoring operations
- Context retrieval remains accurate after multiple changes

**Current Experiments**:
- Tracking comment relevance through refactoring sequences
- Testing different semantic linking algorithms
- Measuring context preservation rates

**Success Criteria**:
- Context preservation >80% through refactoring
- Retrieval accuracy >90%
- Performance overhead <100ms

---

### Hypothesis 3: Team-Specific Learning
**Question**: Do teams have unique patterns worth learning?

**What We're Testing**:
- Teams develop consistent, learnable patterns
- Team-specific patterns provide more value than generic ones
- Pattern evolution is predictable within teams

**Current Experiments**:
- Analyzing pattern consistency within teams
- Comparing team-specific vs generic pattern value
- Tracking pattern evolution over time

**Success Criteria**:
- Team pattern consistency >60%
- Team-specific accuracy improvement >15%
- Pattern stability >6 months

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Cross-Language Pattern Recognition
**Problem**: Same pattern, different syntax across languages

**Approaches Being Tested**:
1. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) normalization
2. Semantic fingerprinting
3. Behavioral equivalence testing

**Open Questions**:
- How much can we normalize without losing meaning?
- What's the performance cost of deep semantic analysis?
- Can we handle polyglot codebases effectively?

---

### Challenge 2: Scale and Performance
**Problem**: Analyzing large codebases in real-time

**Approaches Being Tested**:
1. Incremental analysis with caching
2. Probabilistic pattern matching
3. Distributed processing architecture

**Open Questions**:
- What's the minimum analysis needed for useful results?
- How do we balance accuracy vs speed?
- Can we provide value during initial indexing?

---

### Challenge 3: Privacy-Preserving Pattern Sharing
**Problem**: Learning from multiple teams without exposing code

**Approaches Being Tested**:
1. Differential privacy techniques
2. Federated learning approaches
3. Abstract pattern representation

**Open Questions**:
- How much abstraction before patterns lose value?
- Can we prevent pattern reconstruction attacks?
- What's the minimum data needed for collective learning?

## Theoretical Questions

### Question 1: Pattern Universality
**Investigation**: To what extent do patterns transcend domains?

**What We're Exploring**:
- Core patterns that appear everywhere
- Domain-specific pattern boundaries
- Pattern evolution across domains

**Why It Matters**: Determines feasibility of universal classification

---

### Question 2: Emergence vs Design
**Investigation**: Are patterns discovered or created?

**What We're Exploring**:
- Natural emergence from computational constraints
- Human design choices and conventions
- The balance between emergence and intention

**Why It Matters**: Shapes how we approach pattern classification

---

### Question 3: Complexity Conservation
**Investigation**: Does our system truly reduce complexity or just relocate it?

**What We're Exploring**:
- Total system complexity with and without Anvil
- Where complexity moves when "simplified"
- The true cost of abstraction

**Why It Matters**: Keeps us honest about what we're actually achieving

---

## Validation Experiments

**Setup**: Teams use Anvil vs traditional development

**Measuring**:
- Bug repetition rates
- Time to resolve issues
- Developer satisfaction
- Knowledge retention

**Timeline**: 6-month study with 10+ teams

---

### Experiment 2: Pattern Classification Accuracy
**Setup**: Expert developers classify patterns, compare with system

**Measuring**:
- Classification agreement rates
- Edge case handling
- Cross-language consistency
- Evolution tracking accuracy

**Timeline**: 3-month study with 50+ patterns

---

### Experiment 3: Performance Impact Analysis
**Setup**: Measure Anvil's impact on development workflow

**Measuring**:
- IDE responsiveness
- Build time impact
- Memory usage
- Network overhead (Phase 2)

**Timeline**: Ongoing measurement during pilot phase
