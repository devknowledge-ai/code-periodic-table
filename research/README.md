# Research: Testing Our Hypotheses

*Active experiments and investigations to validate the Anvil approach*

---

## Our Research Philosophy

We treat Anvil development as a research program with testable hypotheses. Every claim we make must be validated through experimentation. We're committed to scientific rigor and transparent reporting of both successes and failures.

## What We're Testing

### Core Hypotheses
1. **Pattern Detection Works**: We can identify when teams are about to repeat mistakes
2. **Context Survives**: Semantic linking preserves knowledge through refactoring
3. **Teams Have Patterns**: Team-specific learning provides more value than generic rules

[**→ Explore Our Open Questions**](./open-questions.md)

## Current Experiments

### Active Studies
- **Pattern Detection Accuracy**: Testing on open-source projects with known bug histories
- **Semantic Linking Resilience**: Tracking context through refactoring sequences
- **Team Pattern Analysis**: Measuring pattern consistency within organizations

### Upcoming Experiments
- A/B testing with development teams
- Cross-language pattern recognition
- Privacy-preserving pattern sharing

## How We Validate

### Quantitative Metrics
- Detection accuracy rates
- False positive percentages
- Performance benchmarks
- User satisfaction scores

### Qualitative Assessment
- Developer interviews
- Usability studies
- Case study analysis
- Community feedback

## Research Integrity

### What We Promise
- **Transparent Reporting**: We publish negative results alongside positive ones
- **Reproducible Methods**: All experiments are documented for replication
- **Open Data**: Anonymized datasets will be publicly available
- **Honest Assessment**: We acknowledge limitations and uncertainties

### What We Don't Know (Yet)
- Whether patterns are truly universal or mostly domain-specific
- The performance cost of real-time semantic analysis
- How much context is needed for accurate pattern detection
- The long-term stability of learned patterns
