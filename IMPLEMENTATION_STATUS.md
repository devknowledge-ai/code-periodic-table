### Phase 2: Community Platform  
- **Documentation Status**: ‚úÖ Architecture defined
- **Specification Status**: ‚úÖ Requirements documented
- **Dependencies**: Requires Phase 1 completion
- **Implementation**: Ready after Phase 1 success
- **Estimated Timeline**: Months 13-24 (begins after Phase 1)

### Phase 3: Universal Classification
- **Documentation Status**: ‚úÖ Research framework established
- **Specification Status**: üîÑ Evolving based on research
- **Research Status**: Long-term exploration
- **Implementation**: Long-term vision (Years 3-5)
- **Research Focus**: Parallel exploration alongside implementation

## Why This Documentation Exists

1. **Define the Vision**: Establish clear goals and approach
2. **Enable Collaboration**: Allow community participation from the start
3. **Reduce Risk**: Document challenges and mitigation strategies
4. **Guide Development**: Provide roadmap for implementation
5. **Foster Transparency**: Share both optimistic and realistic views

## Implementation Timeline (When Resources Secured)

### Realistic Timeline (With Experienced Team):
- **Phase 1 MVP**: 12-18 months (validation of core concepts)
- **Phase 1 Production**: 24+ months (with optimization and refinement)
- **Phase 2 Development**: Years 3-4 (if Phase 1 succeeds)
- **Phase 3 Research**: Years 5+ (exploratory research)

### Resource Requirements:
- **Team**: 3-5 experienced developers
- **Budget**: $500K-$1M for Phase 1
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud services and development tools
- **Community**: 10+ early adopter teams for testing
