# Testable Hypotheses and Falsifiable Claims

*This document converts vague claims into specific, testable hypotheses with clear failure conditions.*

## 1. Core Hypotheses

### H1: Pattern Classification Is Possible

**Vague Claim**: "Programming patterns can be systematically classified"

**Testable Hypothesis**: 
Given a set of 1000 randomly selected code patterns from GitHub:
- At least 3 independent experts can classify 80% of patterns into the same categories
- The inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa) will exceed 0.6
- At least 90% of patterns will fit into one of 50 predefined categories

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If experts agree on less than 60% of classifications → Hypothesis FALSE
- If Cohen's kappa < 0.4 → Hypothesis FALSE
- If more than 30% of patterns don't fit any category → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. Select 1000 patterns randomly from top 100 GitHub projects
2. Have 5 experts independently classify them
3. Measure agreement statistically
4. Timeline: 3 months
5. Cost: ~$50,000

### H2: Semantic Properties Can Be Extracted

**Vague Claim**: "Patterns have identifiable semantic properties"

**Testable Hypothesis**:
An automated system can extract at least 10 semantic properties from code patterns with:
- 70% precision (correct properties identified)
- 60% recall (all properties found)
- Agreement with human experts > 65%

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If precision < 50% → Hypothesis FALSE
- If recall < 40% → Hypothesis FALSE  
- If agreement < 45% → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. Define 10 specific properties (e.g., "validates input", "handles errors")
2. Have experts manually label 500 patterns
3. Run automated extraction
4. Compare results statistically
5. Timeline: 6 months
6. Cost: ~$100,000

### H3: Cross-Language Patterns Exist

**Vague Claim**: "Similar patterns exist across languages"

**Testable Hypothesis**:
For 100 common patterns in Java:
- At least 60% have semantic equivalents in Python
- At least 50% have semantic equivalents in JavaScript
- Automated detection can identify equivalents with 55% accuracy

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If < 40% have Python equivalents → Hypothesis FALSE
- If < 30% have JavaScript equivalents → Hypothesis FALSE
- If detection accuracy < 35% → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. Identify 100 common Java patterns
2. Have experts find equivalents in Python/JS
3. Test automated detection
4. Measure accuracy
5. Timeline: 4 months
6. Cost: ~$75,000

## 2. Performance Hypotheses

### H4: Classification Improves Bug Detection

**Vague Claim**: "Classification helps find bugs"

**Testable Hypothesis**:
Using pattern classification will:
- Increase bug detection rate by at least 15%
- Reduce false positives by at least 10%
- Find at least 5 bug types missed by traditional tools

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If bug detection improves < 5% → Hypothesis FALSE
- If false positives increase → Hypothesis FALSE
- If no unique bugs found → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. Select 50 projects with known bugs
2. Run traditional static analysis
3. Run pattern-based analysis
4. Compare results
5. Timeline: 6 months
6. Cost: ~$150,000

---

### H5: Classification Scales to Real Codebases

**Vague Claim**: "Approach works for real projects"

**Testable Hypothesis**:
The classification system can:
- Process 10,000 files in under 60 minutes
- Use less than 16GB RAM for projects up to 100,000 files
- Maintain >60% accuracy on enterprise codebases

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If 10,000 files take > 2 hours → Hypothesis FALSE
- If RAM usage exceeds 32GB → Hypothesis FALSE
- If accuracy < 40% on large projects → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. Test on progressively larger codebases
2. Measure time and memory usage
3. Validate accuracy on samples
4. Timeline: 3 months
5. Cost: ~$50,000

---

## 3. Adoption Hypotheses

### H6: Developers Will Use Classification

**Vague Claim**: "Developers will adopt this"

**Testable Hypothesis**:
Given 100 developers using the system for 1 month:
- At least 30% will continue using it voluntarily
- Average productivity will increase by at least 5%
- User satisfaction score > 3.5/5.0

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If < 15% continue using → Hypothesis FALSE
- If productivity decreases → Hypothesis FALSE
- If satisfaction < 2.5/5.0 → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. Recruit 100 developers
2. Provide training and tools
3. Measure usage after trial period
4. Survey satisfaction
5. Timeline: 6 months
6. Cost: ~$200,000

## 4. Security Hypotheses

### H7: Classification Reduces Vulnerabilities

**Vague Claim**: "Improves security"

**Testable Hypothesis**:
Projects using classification will have:
- 25% fewer security vulnerabilities in new code
- 20% faster vulnerability detection
- 15% lower remediation time

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If vulnerabilities reduce < 10% → Hypothesis FALSE
- If detection speed unchanged → Hypothesis FALSE
- If remediation time unchanged → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. A/B test with 20 teams
2. Track vulnerabilities over 6 months
3. Measure detection and fix times
4. Timeline: 8 months
5. Cost: ~$300,000

## 5. Economic Hypotheses

### H8: Positive Return on Investment

**Vague Claim**: "Worth the investment"

**Testable Hypothesis**:
For organizations with >50 developers:
- ROI positive within 2 years
- Development cost reduction > 10%
- Maintenance cost reduction > 15%

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If ROI negative after 3 years → Hypothesis FALSE
- If costs increase → Hypothesis FALSE
- If no measurable savings → Hypothesis FALSE

**Test Method**:
1. Pilot with 5 organizations
2. Track all costs and benefits
3. Calculate ROI
4. Timeline: 24 months
5. Cost: ~$1,000,000

## 6. Meta-Hypotheses

### H9: Research Approach Is Valid

**Testable Hypothesis**:
The research methodology will:
- Produce reproducible results (>80% replication)
- Generate actionable insights (>10 implemented improvements)
- Identify when to abandon the approach

**Falsification Criteria**:
- If results can't be replicated → Approach INVALID
- If no actionable insights → Approach INVALID
- If we ignore negative results → Approach INVALID

## Testing Priority and Timeline

| Phase | Hypotheses | Duration | Cost | Go/No-Go Decision |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | H1, H2 | 6 months | $150K | If both fail → STOP |
| 2 | H3, H5 | 4 months | $125K | If both fail → STOP |
| 3 | H4, H7 | 8 months | $450K | If both fail → PIVOT |
| 4 | H6, H8 | 12 months | $500K | If both fail → STOP |

**Total**: 30 months, $1.225M minimum investment

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Viable Success** (at least 4 of 8 hypotheses true):
- Pattern classification possible (H1)
- Properties extractable (H2)
- Scales adequately (H5)
- Developers will use (H6)

**Strong Success** (at least 6 of 8 hypotheses true)

**Failure** (less than 4 hypotheses true) → Abandon approach

## Commitment to Transparency

We commit to:
1. Publishing all results, including failures
2. Stating clearly when hypotheses are falsified
3. Abandoning the approach if core hypotheses fail
4. Not moving goalposts after testing begins
