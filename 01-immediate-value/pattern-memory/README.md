# Pattern Memory System

**Status: Architectural Design Phase - Not Implemented**

## Overview

The Pattern Memory System is a conceptual design for learning and remembering code patterns specific to your team and codebase. This directory contains research and specifications for a system that would adapt to your unique development patterns.

## Core Concept

Unlike static analysis tools that apply generic rules, this system would:
- Learn from YOUR refactoring decisions
- Remember YOUR team's patterns
- Adapt to YOUR coding style
- Evolve with YOUR codebase

## Proposed Components

### Pattern Extraction Engine
Theoretical system to identify recurring patterns in your codebase.

**Conceptual Capabilities:**
- AST-based pattern detection
- Refactoring pattern learning
- Code evolution tracking
- Team preference extraction

**Research Status:** Algorithm design phase

### Memory Storage Layer
Proposed local database for pattern persistence.

**Design Specifications:**
- SQLite for local storage
- Hierarchical pattern organization
- Version-aware pattern tracking
- Privacy-preserving design

**Status:** Schema designed, not implemented

### Adaptive Learning System
Conceptual ML component for pattern refinement.

**Proposed Features:**
- Incremental learning from commits
- Pattern confidence scoring
- Team-specific weighting
- Drift detection and adaptation

**Status:** Research into feasible approaches

## Theoretical Pattern Categories

### Structural Patterns
```python
# System would learn your team prefers this structure:
class ServiceClass:
    def __init__(self, dependency):
        self._dependency = dependency
    
    def process(self, data):
        # Team-specific processing pattern
        validated = self._validate(data)
        result = self._dependency.execute(validated)
        return self._format(result)
```

### Refactoring Patterns
```javascript
// Before: Pattern system notices you consistently refactor from this...
function processUser(u) {
    return u.name + " " + u.age;
}

// After: ...to this style
function processUser(user) {
    const { name, age } = user;
    return `${name} ${age}`;
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```java
// Learns your team's preferred error handling approach
try {
    return performOperation();
} catch (SpecificException e) {
    logger.error("Operation failed", e);
    metrics.increment("operation.failure");
    return fallbackStrategy();
}
```

## Memory Organization

### Proposed Schema
```sql
-- Conceptual database structure
CREATE TABLE patterns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    fingerprint TEXT UNIQUE,
    category TEXT,
    frequency INTEGER,
    confidence REAL,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP,
    team_specific BOOLEAN
);

CREATE TABLE pattern_evolution (
    pattern_id INTEGER,
    commit_hash TEXT,
    change_type TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE pattern_preferences (
    pattern_id INTEGER,
    preference_score REAL,
    rejection_count INTEGER
);
```

## Hypothetical Use Cases

### 1. New Developer Onboarding
- System would teach new team members existing patterns
- Suggest team-preferred approaches
- Prevent divergence from team standards

### 2. Consistency Enforcement
- Alert when code deviates from established patterns
- Suggest refactorings to match team style
- Track pattern adoption metrics

### 3. Evolution Tracking
- Monitor how patterns change over time
- Identify deprecated approaches
- Document pattern migration paths

## Research Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Pattern Equivalence**
   - How to recognize semantically similar patterns?
   - Handling syntax variations

2. **Scalability**
   - Processing large codebases efficiently
   - Memory constraints for pattern storage

3. **Accuracy**
   - Reducing false positives
   - Confidence threshold tuning

### Adoption Challenges
1. **Trust Building**
   - Why should developers trust suggestions?
   - Transparency in pattern selection

2. **Team Dynamics**
   - Handling conflicting preferences
   - Consensus building mechanisms

## Theoretical Performance Metrics

| Pattern extraction time | <5 min for 10K files | Not measured |
| Memory usage | <500MB | Not implemented |
| Suggestion accuracy | >80% acceptance | No data |
| Learning convergence | <100 commits | Theoretical |

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from code formatting tools?**
A: Goes beyond syntax to learn semantic patterns and team preferences.

**Q: Will it work with legacy code?**
A: Theoretically, if sufficient git history exists.

**Q: Can patterns be shared between teams?**
A: Phase 2 would enable selective sharing with privacy controls.

**Q: What about proprietary patterns?**
A: All storage is local; nothing shared without explicit consent.
