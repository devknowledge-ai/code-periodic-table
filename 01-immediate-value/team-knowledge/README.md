# Team Knowledge Capture System

**Status: Conceptual Design - Advanced Documentation System**

## Overview

This directory contains specifications for capturing and preserving team knowledge, particularly the "why" behind code changes. The focus is on adaptive documentation that learns from developer behavior and code review patterns.

## Core Components

### Adaptive Documentation System
Our flagship concept for intelligent documentation capture.

**Key Features:**
- Learns when to prompt for documentation
- Adapts to individual developer preferences
- Learns from code review patterns
- Preserves decision context for future reference

**Learn More:** [adaptive-documentation-system.md](adaptive-documentation-system.md)

## System Goals

### Capture the "Why"
- **Problem:** Critical decisions are lost in generic commit messages
- **Solution:** Context-aware prompting at the right moments
- **Benefit:** Organizational memory and reduced knowledge loss

### Minimize Friction
- **Problem:** Documentation interrupts developer flow
- **Solution:** Adaptive timing and personalized interaction styles
- **Benefit:** Higher engagement and documentation rates

### Learn from Reviews
- **Problem:** Same questions asked repeatedly in code reviews
- **Solution:** Learn patterns from PR comments
- **Benefit:** Preemptive documentation of common concerns

## Key Innovations

### 1. Adaptive Triggering
The system learns when documentation is most valuable:
- Significant architectural changes
- Security-related modifications
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes that address regressions

### 2. Personalized Interaction
Each developer has a unique profile:
- Preferred prompt frequency
- Documentation style (terse vs. detailed)
- Best timing (immediate vs. batched)
- Capture method (text, voice, diagram)

### 3. Code Review Learning
Analyzes PR comments to understand:
- What changes generate questions
- Common clarification requests
- Documentation gaps
- Team conventions

### 4. Privacy-Preserving AI
- Federated learning across teams
- No source code exposure
- Pattern sharing without content
- Differential privacy techniques

## Capture Methods

### Multi-Modal Documentation
- **Text:** Traditional written explanations
- **Voice:** 30-second audio notes
- **Video:** Screen capture with narration
- **Diagrams:** Quick architectural sketches
- **Links:** References to external resources

## Integration Points

### IDE Integration
- VSCode extension
- IntelliJ plugin
- Sublime Text package
- Vim plugin

### Version Control
- Git hooks
- Commit message enhancement
- PR description generation
- Change annotation

### Team Tools
- Slack notifications
- JIRA linking
- Confluence sync
- Teams integration

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Documentation rate | 70% of significant changes | Capture critical decisions |
| Developer engagement | >60% prompt response | Voluntary participation |
| Review questions | 40% reduction | Preemptive clarification |
| Time to document | <30 seconds average | Minimal disruption |
| Knowledge retention | 80% after 3 months | Long-term value |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Capture
- Manual documentation triggers
- Simple templates
- Local storage

### Phase 2: Adaptive Learning
- Behavioral learning
- Personalized prompting
- Code review integration

### Phase 3: AI Enhancement
- Federated learning
- Pattern extraction
- Predictive documentation

## Research Questions

1. How can we detect "documentation-worthy" changes?
2. What prompting strategies maximize engagement?
3. How do we balance thoroughness with efficiency?
4. Can we predict what reviewers will ask?
5. How do we preserve privacy while sharing patterns?

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from commit messages?**
A: Goes beyond "what" to capture "why" with rich context and adaptive prompting.

**Q: Will this slow down development?**
A: Designed to minimize friction through intelligent timing and personalization.

**Q: What about proprietary information?**
A: All data stays local; only anonymized patterns are shared.

**Q: Can it work with existing tools?**
A: Designed to integrate with current development workflows.
