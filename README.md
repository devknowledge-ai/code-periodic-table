# Anvil: Developer Tools That Preserve Team Knowledge

A suite of focused tools that prevent repeated mistakes and preserve institutional knowledge.

## ðŸš€ The Anvil Suite

### [Anvil Comments](./projects/sticky-comments/) 
**Comments that survive refactoring**  
Status: ðŸš§ Early Development | [Try it â†’](./projects/sticky-comments/)

### [Anvil Guard](./projects/null-guard/)
**Prevent null reference exceptions with 95% accuracy**  
Status: ðŸ§ª Beta Testing | [Get Beta â†’](./projects/null-guard/)

### [Anvil Memory](./projects/git-memory/)
**Fast Git history analysis and indexing**  
Status: ðŸš§ Active Development | [Learn more â†’](./projects/git-memory/)

### [Anvil Fingerprint](./projects/code-fingerprint/)
**Semantic hashing for code similarity**  
Status: ðŸ”¬ Research Phase | [Contribute â†’](./projects/code-fingerprint/)

### [Adaptive Documentation](./projects/adaptive-documentation/)
**Capture the "why" behind code changes intelligently**  
Status: ðŸŽ¯ Foundation Component | [Critical Priority â†’](./projects/adaptive-documentation/)

## Why These Tools?

Every developer knows the pain:
- Comments that drift away from the code they describe
- Null pointer bugs that keep coming back
- Git history that's write-only
- Similar code that's impossible to find
- **The "why" behind code changes lost forever**

We're building focused tools to solve these specific problems. Each tool does one thing well.

**Critical Insight**: Adaptive Documentation is the foundation - it transforms noisy Git history (10% signal) into clean, structured knowledge (95% signal), especially when using LLMs like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot.

## How to Contribute

Pick a project that interests you:

| Project | Skills Needed | Time to First PR |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Anvil Comments** | Python, AST parsing | 2-4 hours |
| **Anvil Guard** | Pattern matching, ML basics | 4-8 hours |
| **Anvil Memory** | Database, Git internals | 2-4 hours |
| **Anvil Fingerprint** | Compilers, algorithms | 8-16 hours |
| **Adaptive Documentation** | ML/NLP, IDE integration, flow detection | 4-8 hours |

Each project has its own README with specific contribution guidelines.

## Project Philosophy

- **Small scope** - Each tool solves one problem
- **High quality** - Better to do one thing perfectly
- **Independent value** - Each tool useful standalone
- **Open source** - MIT licensed, community-driven
- **Shared foundation** - Common functionality in [anvil-core](./anvil-core/)

## Future: Deeper Integration

The Anvil tools are designed to work together:

**Foundation Layer:**
- **Adaptive Documentation** captures the "why" behind changes (especially from LLM conversations)
- **Anvil Memory** indexes this enriched history for fast queries

**Intelligence Layer:**
- **Anvil Guard** achieves 95% accuracy by learning from documented fixes
- **Anvil Fingerprint** tracks code evolution semantically
- **Anvil Comments** stay attached through refactoring

**Future Vision:**
- **Anvil Detect** - Combines all tools to prevent repeated mistakes with unprecedented accuracy
- **Anvil Studio** - Unified IDE experience across all tools
- **Anvil Cloud** - Optional team pattern sharing (privacy-first)

The key: Adaptive Documentation provides the clean training data that powers everything else.
