# DevKnowledge: Tools for Preserving Team Knowledge

A collection of focused developer tools that preserve knowledge and prevent repeated mistakes.

## ðŸš€ Active Projects

**Comments that survive refactoring**  
Status: ðŸš§ Early Development | [Try it â†’](./projects/sticky-comments/)

### [NullGuard](./projects/null-guard/)
**Prevent null reference exceptions with 95% accuracy**  
Status: ðŸ§ª Beta Testing | [Get Beta â†’](./projects/null-guard/)

### [GitMemory](./projects/git-memory/)
**Fast Git history analysis and indexing**  
Status: ðŸš§ Active Development | [Learn more â†’](./projects/git-memory/)

### [CodeFingerprint](./projects/code-fingerprint/)
**Semantic hashing for code similarity**  
Status: ðŸ”¬ Research Phase | [Contribute â†’](./projects/code-fingerprint/)

## Why These Tools?

Every developer knows the pain:
- Comments that drift away from the code they describe
- Null pointer bugs that keep coming back
- Git history that's write-only
- Similar code that's impossible to find

We're building focused tools to solve these specific problems. Each tool does one thing well.

## How to Contribute

Pick a project that interests you:

| Project | Skills Needed | Time to First PR |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **StickyComments** | Python, AST parsing | 2-4 hours |
| **NullGuard** | Pattern matching, ML basics | 4-8 hours |
| **GitMemory** | Database, Git internals | 2-4 hours |
| **CodeFingerprint** | Compilers, algorithms | 8-16 hours |

Each project has its own README with specific contribution guidelines.

## Project Philosophy

- **Small scope** - Each tool solves one problem
- **High quality** - Better to do one thing perfectly
- **Independent value** - Each tool useful standalone
- **Open source** - MIT licensed, community-driven

## Future: Integration

Once individual tools prove their value, we'll explore integration:
- **RepeatDetector** - Combines GitMemory + CodeFingerprint
- **Anvil** - Unified experience across all tools

But first, we build the foundations.
