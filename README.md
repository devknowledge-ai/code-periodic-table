# Anvil: Developer Tools That Preserve Team Knowledge

A suite of focused tools that prevent repeated mistakes and preserve institutional knowledge.

## ðŸš€ The Anvil Suite

### [Anvil Comments](./projects/sticky-comments/) 
**Comments that survive refactoring**  
Status: ðŸš§ Early Development | [Try it â†’](./projects/sticky-comments/)

### [Anvil Guard](./projects/null-guard/)
**Prevent null reference exceptions with 95% accuracy**  
Status: ðŸ§ª Beta Testing | [Get Beta â†’](./projects/null-guard/)

### [Anvil Memory](./projects/git-memory/)
**Fast Git history analysis and indexing**  
Status: ðŸš§ Active Development | [Learn more â†’](./projects/git-memory/)

### [Anvil Fingerprint](./projects/code-fingerprint/)
**Semantic hashing for code similarity**  
Status: ðŸ”¬ Research Phase | [Contribute â†’](./projects/code-fingerprint/)

## Why These Tools?

Every developer knows the pain:
- Comments that drift away from the code they describe
- Null pointer bugs that keep coming back
- Git history that's write-only
- Similar code that's impossible to find

We're building focused tools to solve these specific problems. Each tool does one thing well.

## How to Contribute

Pick a project that interests you:

| Project | Skills Needed | Time to First PR |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Anvil Comments** | Python, AST parsing | 2-4 hours |
| **Anvil Guard** | Pattern matching, ML basics | 4-8 hours |
| **Anvil Memory** | Database, Git internals | 2-4 hours |
| **Anvil Fingerprint** | Compilers, algorithms | 8-16 hours |

Each project has its own README with specific contribution guidelines.

## Project Philosophy

- **Small scope** - Each tool solves one problem
- **High quality** - Better to do one thing perfectly
- **Independent value** - Each tool useful standalone
- **Open source** - MIT licensed, community-driven

## Future: Deeper Integration

The Anvil tools are designed to work together. Future plans:
- **Anvil Detect** - Combines Memory + Fingerprint to find repeated bugs
- **Anvil Studio** - Unified IDE experience across all tools
- **Anvil Cloud** - Optional team pattern sharing (privacy-first)

But first, we perfect each individual tool.
