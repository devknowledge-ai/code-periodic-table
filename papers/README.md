## Research Questions

### Open Problems
1. Can patterns be meaningfully classified across languages?
2. What properties of code are decidable vs. undecidable?
3. How do patterns evolve in large codebases?
4. Can AI reliably extract semantic properties?

### Hypotheses to Test
- H1: Team-specific patterns are more valuable than universal patterns
- H2: Domain-specific classification succeeds where universal fails
- H3: Privacy-preserving pattern sharing is technically feasible
- H4: Semantic fingerprinting can achieve 70% accuracy
