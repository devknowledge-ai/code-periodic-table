# Partnership Tracker: Adaptive Documentation Integrations

*Public tracking of our outreach and integration efforts with AI coding assistants*

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Goal**: Partner with open-source AI coding tools to capture high-quality context from developer-AI conversations

## 🎯 Priority Targets

These are our primary partnership targets based on openness, adoption, and technical feasibility:

### 1. Aider (Top Priority)
- **Status**: 🔵 Not Started
- **Why Priority**: Most mature, command-line based, strong Git integration
- **Integration Difficulty**: Low (Python, extensible architecture)
- **Next Steps**: 
  - [ ] Open issue on Aider repo proposing integration
  - [ ] Create proof-of-concept plugin
  - [ ] Submit PR with basic conversation export
- **Contact**: [@paul-gauthier](https://github.com/paul-gauthier)
- **Repo**: [aider-chat/aider](https://github.com/aider-chat/aider)

### 2. Cline (High Priority)
- **Status**: 🔵 Not Started  
- **Why Priority**: VSCode extension, growing adoption, active development
- **Integration Difficulty**: Medium (TypeScript, VSCode API)
- **Next Steps**:
  - [ ] Contact known developers (mentioned by Adrian)
  - [ ] Propose conversation export API
  - [ ] Build VSCode extension bridge
- **Contact**: TBD (Adrian has connection)
- **Repo**: [cline/cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)

### 3. Roo-code (High Priority)
- **Status**: 🔵 Not Started
- **Why Priority**: Developer connections, open to partnerships
- **Integration Difficulty**: Medium
- **Next Steps**:
  - [ ] Reach out to known developers
  - [ ] Discuss integration possibilities
  - [ ] Prototype data exchange format
- **Contact**: TBD (Adrian has connection)
- **Repo**: TBD

## 🤝 Secondary Targets

### 4. Continue.dev
- **Status**: 🔵 Not Started
- **Why Secondary**: Good architecture but smaller user base
- **Integration Difficulty**: Low (open architecture)
- **Repo**: [continuedev/continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue)

### 5. Cursor
- **Status**: 🔴 Blocked
- **Why Secondary**: Closed source, limited extension points
- **Integration Difficulty**: High (proprietary)
- **Alternative**: Focus on open alternatives

### 6. GitHub Copilot
- **Status**: 🔴 Unlikely
- **Why Secondary**: Closed ecosystem, Microsoft-controlled
- **Integration Difficulty**: Very High
- **Alternative**: Wait for official API

## 📊 Integration Levels

We offer three levels of integration complexity:

### Level 0: Basic Export (Minimum Viable)
```typescript
interface BasicExport {
  conversation: Message[];
  timestamp: Date;
  filesModified: string[];
}
```
**Implementation Time**: 1-2 hours
**Value**: Captures raw conversation data

### Level 1: Structured Export
```typescript
interface StructuredExport extends BasicExport {
  decisions: Decision[];
  codeChanges: CodeChange[];
  context: Context;
}
```
**Implementation Time**: 1-2 days
**Value**: Pre-processed, structured data

### Level 2: Real-time Integration
```typescript
interface RealtimeIntegration {
  onDecision: (decision: Decision) => void;
  onCodeAccepted: (code: CodeChange) => void;
  getContext: () => Context;
}
```
**Implementation Time**: 1-2 weeks
**Value**: Live capture, immediate processing
