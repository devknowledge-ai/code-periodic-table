# Sticky Comments → Anvil Context

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project has evolved into [Anvil Context](../anvil-context/)**

The "Sticky Comments" concept has been expanded and integrated into the more comprehensive **Anvil Context** system, which provides:
- Living documentation for code, errors, and crashes
- Context that travels with code through refactoring
- Integration with the broader Anvil Suite

## Migration

All development efforts have moved to [Anvil Context](../anvil-context/). 

Please see:
- [Anvil Context README](../anvil-context/README.md) - Current development
- [Migration Guide](../anvil-context/MIGRATION_FROM_STICKY_COMMENTS.md) - How the concepts evolved

## Why the Change?

During [The Great Simplification](../../THE_GREAT_SIMPLIFICATION.md), we realized that "sticky comments" were just one aspect of a larger need: preserving all forms of context (not just comments) with code as it evolves.

Anvil Context encompasses:
- The original sticky comments functionality
- Error and crash context
- Performance notes and warnings
- Architectural decisions
- And more...
