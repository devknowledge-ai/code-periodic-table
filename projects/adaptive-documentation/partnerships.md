# Partnership Opportunities: AI Coding Assistants

## The Strategic Pivot: Build With, Not Against

Instead of trying to capture data from closed platforms (GitHub Copilot, Claude), we partner with open-source AI coding assistants that already own the conversation data.

## Prime Partnership Targets

### 1. Roo-code
- **What**: Open-source VS Code extension for AI pair programming
- **Why Perfect**: Already captures full conversation history
- **Integration Opportunity**: Native documentation generation from sessions
- **Contact Strategy**: Reach out to maintainers with working prototype

### 2. Cline (formerly Claude Dev)
- **What**: Autonomous AI assistant for VS Code
- **Why Perfect**: Has complete context of what it builds and why
- **Integration Opportunity**: Automatic PR descriptions and commit messages
- **Contact Strategy**: Propose as differentiating feature

### 3. Continue.dev
- **What**: Open-source autopilot for VS Code and JetBrains
- **Why Perfect**: Focuses on customization and control
- **Integration Opportunity**: Built-in knowledge management system
- **Contact Strategy**: Align with their "bring your own LLM" philosophy

### 4. Aider
- **What**: Command-line AI pair programming tool
- **Why Perfect**: Git-aware, already generates commit messages
- **Integration Opportunity**: Enhanced commit context and documentation
- **Contact Strategy**: Build on their existing git integration
- **Unique Advantage**: Works with any editor, not just VS Code

### 5. Mentat
- **What**: Command-line AI coding assistant

- **Contact Strategy**: "Document as you build" feature

### 8. Smol Developer
- **What**: Minimalist AI developer
- **Why Interesting**: Simple architecture, easy to extend
- **Integration Opportunity**: Lightweight documentation layer
- **Contact Strategy**: Contribute as core feature

### 9. Cursor (Commercial - Stretch Goal)
- **What**: Full IDE with AI built-in
- **Why Interesting**: Controls entire development environment
- **Challenge**: Commercial product, may be less open
- **Opportunity**: Enterprise differentiation

### 10. GitHub Copilot Workspace (Future)
- **What**: GitHub's upcoming AI development environment
- **Why Strategic**: Official GitHub product
- **Challenge**: Closed ecosystem
- **Opportunity**: If they open APIs, immediate integration

## Partnership Priority Tiers

### Tier 1: Immediate Opportunities (Start Here)
- **Aider** - Already git-aware, natural fit for documentation
- **Cline** - Active community, open to contributions
- **Roo-code** - Your existing contacts

### Tier 2: Strong Potential
- **Continue.dev** - Philosophy alignment
- **Mentat** - Codebase understanding synergy
- **Sweep** - PR documentation is obvious value

### Tier 3: Experimental
- **GPT-Engineer** - Different use case but interesting
- **Smol Developer** - Easy to prototype with
- **Cursor** - If they're open to partnerships

### Special Note: Why Aider is Perfect

Aider is particularly well-suited because:
1. **Already commits code** - Natural place to add documentation
2. **Git-native** - Understands repository context
3. **Command-line tool** - Easy to extend with plugins
4. **Active development** - Responsive maintainer (Paul Gauthier)
5. **Clean architecture** - Well-documented codebase

Example integration with Aider:
```bash
# Current Aider workflow
aider "fix the login bug"
# Aider makes changes and commits

# With Adaptive Documentation
aider "fix the login bug" --document
# Aider makes changes, extracts context, and commits with rich documentation
```

## The Value Exchange

### What We Offer Them

1. **Competitive Differentiation**
   - "The AI assistant that documents as it codes"
   - "Never lose context of why AI wrote something"
   - "Automatic knowledge base from coding sessions"

2. **Enhanced User Value**
   ```typescript
   // Before: AI generates code
   const result = await processUser(userData);
   
   // After: AI generates code + context
   const result = await processUser(userData);
   // Context: Added null check because user reported crashes
   // when userData is undefined (conversation: session-123)
   ```

3. **Learning Loop**
   - Track which AI suggestions lead to bugs
   - Improve future suggestions based on outcomes
   - Build team-specific knowledge over time

### What We Need From Them

1. **Data Access**
   ```typescript
   interface RequiredAPI {
     // Conversation history
     getConversation(): Message[]
     
     // Code tracking
     onCodeAccepted(callback: (code, context) => void)
     onCodeRejected(callback: (code, reason) => void)
     
     // Integration points
     onPreCommit(callback: () => CommitContext)
     onCodeReview(callback: () => Documentation)
   }
   ```

2. **User Consent Flow**
   - Opt-in for documentation generation
   - Control over what gets saved
   - Privacy settings for sensitive code

3. **Co-marketing**
   - Joint blog posts about the integration
   - Shared credit in documentation
   - Conference talks about AI + documentation

## Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Show it works with minimal integration

```typescript
// Simple export button
export class SimpleDocExporter {
  static export(conversation: Message[]): Documentation {
    return {
      summary: extractSummary(conversation),
      decisions: extractDecisions(conversation),
      code_blocks: extractCode(conversation)
    }
  }
}
```

**Deliverable**: Video demo showing conversation â†’ documentation

### Phase 2: MVP Integration (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Basic working integration

```typescript
// Automatic commit message generation
export class CommitMessageGenerator {
  static fromConversation(
    conversation: Message[],
    changedFiles: string[]
  ): string {
    const purpose = extractPurpose(conversation);
    const approach = extractApproach(conversation);
    return `${purpose}\n\n${approach}\n\n[AI-Assisted Development]`;
  }
}
```

**Deliverable**: Pull request to their repository

### Phase 3: Full Integration (Week 5-8)
**Goal**: Complete feature set

```typescript
// Full adaptive documentation system
export class AdaptiveDocumentation {
  constructor(private aiTool: AIToolAPI) {
    this.setupHooks();
    this.initializelearning();
  }
  
  async captureContext(): Promise<Documentation> {
    const conversation = await this.aiTool.getConversation();
    const code = await this.aiTool.getAcceptedCode();
    const context = this.extractContext(conversation, code);
    
    // Link to code semantically
    const fingerprints = this.generateFingerprints(code);
    
    // Store for future reference
    await this.store(context, fingerprints);
    
    return context;
  }
}
```

**Deliverable**: Shipped feature in their tool

## Outreach Templates

### Initial Contact Email

```markdown
Subject: Enhancing [Tool] with Automatic Documentation from AI Sessions

Hi [Maintainer Name],

I've been following [Tool Name] and love how it [specific feature]. I'm working on Adaptive Documentation, which automatically extracts the "why" from AI coding conversations.

Your tool already has the perfect data - the full conversation between developer and LLM. What if we could:

1. Auto-generate meaningful commit messages from the conversation
2. Create documentation that links code to its original requirements
3. Help teams understand AI-generated code months later

I've built a prototype that can extract documentation from conversation JSON. Would you be interested in exploring an integration?

This could be a powerful differentiator - making [Tool Name] the first AI assistant that preserves not just what was built, but why.

Here's a quick demo: [link to video]

Interested in a 15-minute call next week?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-up Technical Proposal

```markdown

## Success Metrics for Partnerships

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Response Rate | 50% reply to outreach | Email tracking |
| Interest Rate | 25% willing to explore | Follow-up calls |
| Integration Rate | 1-2 successful integrations | Shipped features |
| User Adoption | 20% of their users try it | Telemetry |
| Retention | 10% regular usage | Weekly active users |

## Why This Strategy Works

1. **Immediate Access**: No need to wait for APIs that may never come
2. **Aligned Incentives**: Both parties benefit from integration
3. **Proven Demand**: These tools have active user bases
4. **Technical Feasibility**: They already have the data we need
5. **Open Source Friendly**: Most are receptive to contributions

## Next Steps

1. **Research Each Tool**: Understand their architecture and community
2. **Build Generic Prototype**: Show value without deep integration
3. **Reach Out**: Start with most receptive communities
4. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Adapt to what they need
5. **Ship Something Real**: Get actual users as soon as possible
