# Pattern Lifecycle Manager: From Birth to Death

## The Problem

Code patterns have lifecycles—they're born, they evolve, they decay, and they die. Yet we treat them as static entities. We don't track:
- When and why a pattern was introduced
- How its stability changes over time
- Early warning signs of decay
- Why patterns are finally retired

This blindness to pattern lifecycle leads to:
- Keeping dead patterns alive (zombie code)
- Missing early signs of instability
- Losing context about pattern evolution
- Repeatedly resurrecting failed patterns

## Core Concept

The Pattern Lifecycle Manager treats code patterns as living entities with measurable lifecycles, providing complete visibility from introduction to retirement.

### Lifecycle Stages

```typescript
enum PatternStage {
  EXPERIMENTAL = "Just introduced, stability unknown",
  EMERGING = "Showing promise, being adopted",
  STABLE = "Mature, widely used, reliable",
  DECLINING = "Showing signs of decay",
  DEPRECATED = "Marked for removal",
  EXTINCT = "Removed from codebase"
}

interface PatternLifecycle {
  // Birth
  birth: {
    timestamp: Date;
    introducer: Developer;
    reason: string;
    initialContext: Context;
    expectedLifespan?: Duration;
  };
  
  // Life
  stages: StageTransition[];
  healthMetrics: HealthMetric[];
  mutations: Evolution[];
  
  // Death
  death?: {
    timestamp: Date;
    reason: string;
    replacedBy?: PatternFingerprint;
    lessonsLearned: string[];
  };
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Birth Certificate Generation

#### Automatic Detection
```python
class PatternBirthDetector:
    def detect_new_patterns(self, commit):
        new_patterns = []
        
        for file in commit.changed_files:
            # Identify patterns not seen before
            current_patterns = self.extract_patterns(file.after)
            previous_patterns = self.extract_patterns(file.before)
            
            for pattern in current_patterns:
                if pattern not in previous_patterns:
                    birth_cert = self.generate_birth_certificate(
                        pattern=pattern,
                        commit=commit,
                        context=self.extract_context(commit)
                    )
                    new_patterns.append(birth_cert)
        
        return new_patterns
```

#### Birth Context Capture
```python
@dataclass
class BirthCertificate:
    pattern_id: str
    fingerprint: str
    birth_date: datetime
    
    # Why was it born?
    trigger: str  # "bug_fix", "feature", "refactor", "optimization"
    problem_solved: str
    alternatives_considered: List[str]
    
    # Who gave birth?
    creator: Developer
    reviewers: List[Developer]
    
    # Birth conditions
    codebase_size: int
    team_size: int
    dependencies: List[str]
    
    # Predictions
    expected_lifespan: Optional[timedelta]
    expected_stability: float
```

### 2. Health Monitoring

#### Continuous Health Metrics
```python
class PatternHealthMonitor:
    def calculate_health(self, pattern: Pattern) -> HealthScore:
        return HealthScore(
            # Stability indicators
            modification_frequency=self.calc_modification_rate(pattern),
            bug_association=self.count_bug_fixes_near_pattern(pattern),
            
            # Usage indicators
            spread_rate=self.measure_adoption_rate(pattern),
            instance_count=self.count_instances(pattern),
            
            # Quality indicators
            complexity_trend=self.track_complexity_change(pattern),
            coupling_score=self.measure_coupling(pattern),
            
            # Team indicators
            developer_sentiment=self.analyze_comments_about_pattern(pattern),
            review_friction=self.measure_review_difficulty(pattern)
        )
```

#### Health Visualization

### 3. Evolution Tracking

#### Mutation Detection
```python
class PatternEvolutionTracker:
    def track_mutations(self, pattern: Pattern) -> Evolution:
        mutations = []
        
        for version in self.get_pattern_versions(pattern):
            changes = self.diff_versions(version.previous, version.current)
            
            mutation = Mutation(
                timestamp=version.timestamp,
                type=self.classify_change(changes),
                magnitude=self.measure_change_size(changes),
                trigger=self.identify_trigger(version.commit),
                impact=self.assess_impact(changes)
            )
            
            mutations.append(mutation)
        
        return Evolution(
            pattern=pattern,
            mutations=mutations,
            trajectory=self.calculate_trajectory(mutations)
        )
```

### 4. Death and Post-Mortem

#### Death Certificate
```python
@dataclass
class DeathCertificate:
    pattern_id: str
    death_date: datetime
    
    # Cause of death
    primary_cause: str  # "obsolete", "buggy", "replaced", "refactored"
    contributing_factors: List[str]
    
    # Final stats
    total_lifespan: timedelta
    total_instances: int
    total_bugs_caused: int
    total_developers_touched: int
    
    # Succession
    replaced_by: Optional[PatternFingerprint]
    migration_path: Optional[str]
    
    # Lessons
    post_mortem: str
    recommendations: List[str]
```

#### Pattern Obituary Generator
```python
class PatternObituary:
    def generate(self, death_cert: DeathCertificate) -> str:
        return f"""
        PATTERN OBITUARY
        ================
        
        {death_cert.pattern_id}
        {death_cert.birth_date} - {death_cert.death_date}
        
        After {death_cert.total_lifespan.days} days of service,
        this pattern has been laid to rest.
        
        Cause of Death: {death_cert.primary_cause}
        
        It is survived by {death_cert.replaced_by or 'no direct successor'}.
        
        During its lifetime, it:
        - Served {death_cert.total_instances} locations
        - Was modified {death_cert.total_modifications} times
        - Caused {death_cert.total_bugs_caused} bugs
        - Was touched by {death_cert.total_developers_touched} developers
        
        Lessons Learned:
        {death_cert.post_mortem}
        
        "May its bugs rest in peace and its lessons live on."
        """
```

### 5. Resurrection Detection

```python
class ResurrectionDetector:
    def detect_zombie_patterns(self, codebase):
        """Find patterns that have returned from the dead"""
        
        zombies = []
        extinct_patterns = self.get_extinct_patterns()
        
        for pattern in self.scan_current_patterns(codebase):
            if self.matches_extinct(pattern, extinct_patterns):
                zombie = ZombiePattern(
                    pattern=pattern,
                    previous_death=extinct_patterns[pattern],
                    resurrection_date=datetime.now(),
                    warning_level=self.assess_danger(pattern)
                )
                zombies.append(zombie)
        
        return zombies
    
    def warn_about_zombie(self, zombie: ZombiePattern):
        return f"""
        ⚠️ ZOMBIE PATTERN DETECTED
        
        This pattern died {zombie.previous_death.date} due to:

        It caused {zombie.previous_death.bugs} bugs before.

## Conclusion

The Pattern Lifecycle Manager transforms code patterns from static text into living entities with measurable lifecycles. By tracking patterns from birth to death, we can:

- Make informed decisions about pattern adoption
- Detect decay before it becomes critical
- Learn from pattern evolution
- Prevent resurrection of failed patterns

This isn't just tracking—it's understanding the natural history of code patterns in their ecosystem.
