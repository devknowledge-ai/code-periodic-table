# Vision and Research

*A concise overview of where the Anvil Suite is heading and the research questions it explores*

## Our Vision in One Sentence

**Build practical developer tools that capture and preserve team knowledge, while generating data to understand how code patterns evolve.**

## The Practical Vision (What We're Building)

### Near Term (2025)
Simple, focused tools that solve real problems:
- **Adaptive Documentation** captures the "why" behind code changes
- **Anvil Guard** prevents null/None bugs with 95% accuracy
- **Anvil Memory** makes Git history searchable and useful
- **Anvil Comments** keeps comments attached to moving code
- **Anvil Fingerprint** creates stable identities for code patterns

### Medium Term (2026)
Tools that learn from each other:
- Guard learns from patterns Memory discovers
- Comments warn about historical bugs Guard found
- Fingerprint tracks pattern evolution across all tools
- Adaptive Documentation gets smarter about when to capture context

### Long Term (2027+)
A suite that prevents repeated mistakes:
- Teams never make the same error twice
- Institutional knowledge becomes truly permanent
- Pattern evolution becomes predictable
- Code quality improves measurably over time

## The Research Questions (What We're Learning)

As our tools generate data from real usage, we explore these questions:

### 1. Do Code Patterns Have Lifecycles?
Can we predict when a pattern will become obsolete? Do patterns "decay" in predictable ways?

*[Deep dive: Pattern Evolution Theory](./docs/archive/research-horizon/03-research-vision/experiments/pattern-evolution-theory.md)*

### 2. Why Do Teams Repeat Mistakes?
If we capture the context of bug fixes, can we prevent similar bugs? How much context is enough?

*[Deep dive: Adaptive Documentation Research](./projects/adaptive-documentation/research.md)*

### 3. Can Code Have Stable Identity?
Can we fingerprint code in a way that survives refactoring? What makes a pattern "the same" after changes?

*[Deep dive: Fingerprinting Theory](./docs/archive/research-horizon/03-research-vision/experiments/semantic-property-framework.md)*

### 4. Is There a "Physics" of Code?
Do code patterns follow predictable rules like physical systems? Are there "conservation laws" in software?

*[Deep dive: Digital Universe Theory](./docs/archive/vision/digital-universe-theory.md)* *(Note: Highly speculative)*

## How Tools Drive Research

We follow a simple cycle:

```
Tools solve problems → Generate data → Answer research questions → Improve tools
```

**Example**: 
- NullGuard catches bugs (tool)
- Tracks which patterns cause null errors (data)
- Discovers 73% follow 5 patterns (research)
- Improves detection accuracy to 95% (better tool)

## What Makes Us Different

### We're NOT:
- Building a comprehensive classification system upfront
- Creating complex theoretical frameworks
- Trying to solve everything at once
- Letting research block tool development

### We ARE:
- Shipping practical tools quickly
- Learning from real usage data
- Letting insights emerge naturally
- Keeping tools simple and focused

## For Different Audiences

### For Developers
Focus on the tools. Each solves a specific problem you face today. The research happens in the background.

### For Contributors
Pick a tool that interests you. You don't need to understand the research to contribute valuable code.

### For Researchers
Our tools generate rich data about code evolution. We welcome analysis and insights, but tools ship first.

### For Companies
Practical value today (better code quality), strategic value tomorrow (predictive pattern analysis).

## The Simplification Principle

After trying to build everything at once, we learned:
- **Simple tools ship, complex systems don't**
- **Real data beats theoretical frameworks**
- **Focused solutions beat comprehensive platforms**
- **Today's utility beats tomorrow's perfection**

## Join the Journey

You don't need to care about the long-term vision to contribute. Pick a tool, solve a problem, ship code. The research will follow naturally from real-world usage.
