## Research Integrity

As a research-oriented community, we additionally commit to:

### Scientific Integrity

- Acknowledge uncertainties and limitations
- Correct errors when discovered
- Give credit where credit is due

### Open Science
- Share data and methods when possible
- Make research reproducible
- Welcome replication attempts
- Document failed approaches

### Collaborative Ethics
- Respect others' research efforts
- Build upon work with proper attribution
- Share knowledge freely
- Support diverse research approaches

## Community Values in Practice

### In Discussions
- "I disagree because..." not "You're wrong"
- "Have you considered..." not "Obviously you should..."
- "This didn't work for me" not "This is useless"
- "I don't understand" not "This makes no sense"

### In Code Reviews
- "This could be improved by..." not "This is bad code"
- "Consider this alternative..." not "Do it this way"
- "This might cause issues with..." not "This will break everything"

### In Research
- "Our results suggest..." not "We proved..."
- "Under these conditions..." not "Always..."
- "We were unable to replicate..." not "Their work is flawed"
